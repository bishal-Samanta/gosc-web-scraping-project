This occurs because of the contention between HPX threads and OpenMP's native threading system (i.e., pthread) over available resources. hpxMP aims at resolving this issue by adding support for HPX threads as an alternative to pthreads in LLVM OpenMP. This work relies on the HPXC, which replicates pthread's API."

The goal of the project is to utilise HPX facilities such as components and actions and futures to create an I/O library for asynchronous and distributed I/O. 

The library will enable an interface which will allow the user to send asynchronous or synchronous I/O requests to a cluster of compute nodes. This will also speedup I/O using several nodes to perform I/O parallely."

Nevertheless, there is still room for improvement in data movement operations. Proposal P1144 introduces std::relocate, a feature designed to optimize data relocation by making it safer, faster, and greatly simpler. Essentially, std::relocate utilizes a single memcpy operation to move objects while avoiding unnecessary move-constructor and destructor calls. This improvement impacts key primitives like swap and vector.reserve, subsequently leading to speedup in higher-level algorithms such as rotate and sort. The goal of this proposal is to implement relocation in HPX."

The address format is in block style, and is different from address formats in other regions. In addition, the language used is Japanese, and English is not commonly used. As a result, Japanese users face many challenges when searching for locations in Japan using Nominatim. In this proposal, I will address the issue of Japanese Kanji being recognized as Chinese characters, resulting in incorrect locations being returned. Specifically, we will conduct morphological analysis on Japanese searches and perform proper word segmentation at appropriate positions.

The objectives of this proposal are as follows:
Ensure that Nominatim does not mistake Japanese searches for Chinese.
Ensure that Japanese location searches return locations within Japan.
Ensure that Nominatim correctly identifies the block and house numbers in Japanese addresses, avoiding confusion between the two."

The existing implementation, which started in 2015 using native Vanilla JavaScript, lacks modern front-end tooling and ecosystem standards, leading to difficulties in maintenance and subpar performance.

The v4 project uses improved application architecture, modern tools (such as Vite, ESLint, Prettier, Docker, Jest, Cypress, etc.), better languages (TypeScript and Sass), and libraries (React for UI rendering). This will significantly enhance the overall developer and user experience, maintainability, and performance.

The proposal focuses on implementing one of the main features of Music Blocks, the ""Project Builder"", which is currently missing in the new version (v4). The Project Builder is a graphical blocks manager module used to create Music Blocks programs, including interactive blocks like Start, Rhythm, Note, Pitch, Instrument, and many more. These blocks can be dragged, dropped, and clicked to perform actions or open context menus.

By implementing the Project Builder feature end-to-end, users will be able to create different musical patterns seamlessly.

Currently, the project relies purely on static analysis of code structures to identify patterns. This project extends capa to work on dynamic execution data such as sandbox run traces or code emulation analysis.

The introduction of dynamic analysis to capa is set to make analyzing samples that feature anti-analysis techniques a much easier task. This is an issue of concern since a large number of distributed software nowadays gets packed with commercial or private packers, which means that capa would fail to profile these executables' capabilities successfully. However, this can be circumvented by introducing dynamic analysis to the problem, which it would enable capa to get a view of the program after it had been unpacked in memory, thereby making it possible to extract the capabilities from the executable at hand.

Deliverables:
1. Add support for the future integration of several sandbox solutions by means of an associated feature extractor.
2. Implement a feature extractor for the Cuckoo-based CAPE Malware Configuration and Payload Extractor.
3. Introduce capa features that are specific to dynamic analysis (such as captured network traffic).
4. Add dynamic-based support for function call arguments.
5. Write novel rules that make use of the newly introduced dynamic capability extraction."

Secondly, although there are many open-source utilities (e.g., Apache JMeter, httperf), no specific tool is designed to evaluate performance affected by a firewall.

I plan to adapt existing Rust API `start_os_proxy()` and `stop_os_proxy()`, that currently works only on Windows (trough packet_sources/windows.rs), to MacOS and Linux creating new crates `osx.rs` and `linux.rs` that will use properly osx-specific APIs.

In addition, I will also adapt the existing `--mode osproxy[:pid or executable name] `command-line option to allow users to specify a PID or executable name for the process to be intercepted by mitmproxy.

There are two possible approaches that can be taken:

1. The first is to use packet filter (pf) for macOS, initially trying to swallow all traffic coming from the same machine that is launching packet filter itself. The second step in this approach will be to use some gimmick to figure out which packets are actually coming from mitmproxy and filter them out to avoid loops, a possible solution for this could be to use nettop, launching it as a command directly from rust, the solution is not definitive and possible alternatives should be explored to understand the privilege issue as well.
2. A second approach is to use NEAppProxyProvider: an Apple proprietary framework that extends the functionality of the iOS and MacOS network stack. With NEAPP we can implement custom rules for filtering, routing, and modifying network traffic based on a variety of criteria, such as the app, the network protocol, the destination address, or the user identity. As it is a proprietary framework, we need to develop in Swift or objective-C and then transmit the information to the main mitmproxy stack.

How other proxies or VPN actually work:
- WireGuard: wireguard has a apple version written in Swift, the adopted approach is the second one, it uses Apple Network Interfaces [ source ]
- Squid: the same problem is  currently unsolved
- TinyProxy: it uses  POSIX and no https transparent proxy"

Ultimate Alarm Clock is a mobile app that aims to provide features that other alarm clocks don’t have such as conditional alarms based on location, phone activity, weather, or shared settings. Besides these, the clock will also include unique features to dismiss the alarm such as scanning a QR/Bar code, solving simple math problems of varying difficulty or shaking the phone. This is an open-source, free, and ad-free project that's built with Flutter.

Proposed Deliverables

- A Flutter application that runs as a foreground service and uses Firestore as its database which would hold all the alarms created by the user.
- This app would allow users to set conditional alarms by tracking their phone activity, location, weather or shared settings.
- It would also enable users to set up unique challenges such as scanning a QR/Bar code, solving simple mathematical questions of varying difficulty or shaking the phone to dismiss the alarm.
- Set up end-to-end testing using GitHub Actions to ensure that the application does not break in Android or iOS.

Additionally, if time permits, I'd also like to work on the following features:

- Implementing some other features such as showing the weather forecast or motivational quotes on the dismissed screen. 
- Making an option to allow users to set quick alarms (alarms relative to the current time, say 10 minutes from now) with intervals (say 6 alarms at an interval of 10 minutes between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM)

Plan of Implementation

To implement the core functionalities, I will set up the application as a foreground service which will ensure that the alarms set will persist through reboots.

The unique features such as conditional alarms or dismissal challenges can be implemented using open source packages such as weather, location, and so on."

Among all the brightness variations we can study in these sources, periodic and quasi-periodic oscillations are among the most interesting, because they can provide insights into the astrophysical processes in these objects. While the stingray package is a valuable tool for analyzing periodic data, its analysis of quasi-periodic data is limited by biases in frequency domain methods. To mitigate these limitations, a Gaussian process regression (a time domain method) can be used to model the time series for a kernel describing a QPO. Using Bayesian Inferencing, we can infer its parameters and assign them physical meaning related to the physics of the process and perform model selection between QPOs and alternative models. This can be used to reliably detect QPOs, and infer their physical properties. Such methods have already been implemented in recent papers (Huebner et al,2022), and the goal of this project will be to simplify their code and implement it in Stingray using the Tinygp library for the GP backend.

It uses a line-by-line approach, where each absorption or emission line of a molecule is computed by accounting for the influence of environmental parameters. High-temperature spectral calculations require resolving the shape of tens of millions of lines, which is the usual performance bottleneck. RADIS implements a new algorithm to compute these lineshapes and is already one of the fastest line-by-line spectral codes available. It can also compute many different types of spectra (absorption/emission/equilibrium / non-equilibrium). 

However, although the algorithm is very CPU/GPU efficient, the RADIS code is still memory hungry. Databases are currently loaded in RADIS using the VAEX [3] package, but the operations to calculate the spectra are performed using the PANDAS library. VAEX is a similar table management tool to PANDAS but uses memory mapping, a zero-memory copy policy, and lazy computations for the best performance. 

 The main goal of the current project is to refactor RADIS so that dataframes are only manipulated via the VAEX format. Potentially, this work would make it possible to compute spectral databases of up to billions of lines (hundreds of GB or terabyte-scale databases)."

Traditional methods either rely on homology searches to map the open reading frames to previously identified protein-coding genes or utilize additional experimental data, e.g., transcriptomics data. The first approach produces potentially inaccurate results if the genome of interest is not at least somewhat related to an already annotated genome. The second approach is hindered because gathering transcriptomic data is labor-intensive and expensive. For that reason, there is a high demand for models that predict the location of protein-coding genes solely from inherent features of the DNA sequence of the gene. Although theoretically possible, methods that use, for instance, Hidden Markov models to detect protein-coding genes based on known gene features are often inaccurate. In this project, we will train a Deep Learning Transformer model to extract features of protein-coding genes to gain deeper insight into their exact properties that lead to translation.

anticipation of industry adoption, the FFmpeg community has embarked on the
ffvvc project, aiming to bring a VVC decoder into FFmpeg, the open source 
multimedia processing framework. FFmpeg is the backbone to many open source
multimedia technologies, so a high-performance VVC decoder in FFmpeg will
allow many other projects to process VVC-encoded video without the baggage
of closed-source decoders. 

While modern compilers like Clang and GCC can employ tons of optimization
techniques to speed up a compiled program, compilers are still not capible
of generating high-performance code for DSP and video processing workloads.
Modern compilers also struggle with the SIMD extensions introduced by CPU
manufacturers, such as the AVX2 extensions released by Intel in 2014. These
SIMD extensions massively improve performance in DSP and video processing workloads, and FFmpeg's HEVC decoder already employs AVX2 SIMD instructions to improve performance.

Given that previous work into writing HEVC decoding filters in x86_64
assembly with SIMD instructed yielded tangible performance improvements, this
proposal aims to implement the VVC deblocking filter in x86_64 assembly

A hard inner boundary in velocity is set from which radiative packets are emitted through the ejecta according to a black-body distribution at a given temperature. Currently, TARDIS can solve for the radiative and inner boundary temperatures as well as dilution factors given a static inner velocity boundary. The precise location of where this inner boundary velocity should be placed is not always obvious and there are a few methods by which one can intelligently select a location based on the properties of the plasma (which are constantly updating over each iteration).

This project will aim to update the location of the inner boundary velocity based on a set of options for desired properties of the plasma at each iteration. The options include setting the inner boundary velocity according to a given optical depth over all frequencies (either Planck or Rossland mean opacities) or setting the inner boundary according to a desired value for the dilution factors.

The project can be broken down into the following four deliverables:

- Estimating the inner velocity value based on target values of optical depth and dilution factor

A regular Grotrian diagram would only display the overall line interaction for the packets that interact with the ion, but we also want to display how many packets went through each specific transition and the level populations. One way it could be done is to color each arrow to represent quantity of packets (similar to a heatmap) and the thickness of the level platforms denoting the level populations.

Solution:

To address this issue, a web-based user interface will be developed that will provide l an accessible and user-friendly platform for users to interact with and explore their vector data. This tool will allow users to quickly visualize their data, perform exploratory data analysis, and gain insights into their data without relying on external code. Additionally, a web-based interface will be more accessible to a broader range of users, including those without advanced programming or data analysis skills.

However, straightforward algorithms run into problems when rendering with few pixels available.  For example, fonts where the capital “O” is taller than the capital “T”, or vice versa, should have these characters rendered at the same height when few pixels are available to avoid bumpy-looking text.  Many modern font formats  contain “hints” in these cases, which tell the renderer how it should align each symbol in the font to the pixel grid to create the most legible and consistent rendering.  However, not all fonts and font formats contain hints.  In these cases, the auto-hinter can be enabled, which analyzes the shapes in the font to fix some common issues that would normally be fixed by manually added hints.

To tackle the problem we start by looking at research that have looked deep into model architectures and methods that work well with imaging modalities, for example Alexnet have proven to work on modalities like Head CT. We then collect the imaging data necessary to train out models and also decide on the method of training like transfer learning on pretrained models or do we go ahead with training a model from scratch. Appropriate feature engineering and tuning will be part of the problem solving process. Once we establish a model to perform well on a modality we proceed to integrate the model to the AI Model service application.

The deliverables will include
- Collate information on data sources, methods and models that will be used for implementation and review with mentor(s)
- For any modality, start with data preparation, feature engineering, training and evaluation until satisfactory performance is achieved. Here we will trial different augmentation techniques and hyperparameter tuning methods. 
- Integrate the model inferencing code and retraining code to the application for all modalities
- Add methods to the Flask API to appropriately call the specific AI model for a modality. Modify existing methods as necessary so as to include the new AI models

Although frameworks like Netty and NIO2 make this approach seem reasonable, the use of separate event loop threads is not without cost. In high-RPS services, these threads can compete for CPU time with worker threads executing application tasks, leading to resource contention and potentially significant performance loss. In contrast, Cats Effect offers a different threading model, integrating I/O and application tasks into a single runtime system, reducing contention an enhancing overall efficiency.

io_uring, the key component of this project, offers two major advantages: (1) it enables all supported syscalls to become asynchronous from the application’s perspective, allowing for multiple syscalls to be initiated in parallel without blocking the calling thread, and (2) it uses a pair of ring buffers for syscall submission and completion events that are shared between the application and the kernel, dramatically reducing the overhead of calling from userspace into kernelspace. When integrated with Cats Effect, io_uring can significantly improve the efficiency of syscalls, requiring fewer calls into kernelspace during the worker loop. 

This proposal brings two key innovations together: a new threading model and a new I/O API. By integrating Cats Effects and FS2 with io_uring, we aim to develop an alternative solution to minimize the inefficiencies found in the traditional model, offering a more efficient and performant solution for I/O-intensive applications."

In this project, we aim for two goals:
1. The current implementation of quote pattern matching does not have many tests and is expected to be unstable. I propose making the feature more reliable by creating a checklist that captures which language features should be supported and adding more automated tests based on the checklist.
2. The current quote pattern matching does not support extraction of polymorphic functions. I propose extending HOAS patterns to support pattern matching against polymorphic functions based on formal

With a multitude of theories employed in these solvers, it is beneficial to have access to a diverse range of solvers and to minimize the challenge of learning a new API for each of them. Using the solver’s own API directly makes it difficult to switch to another solver without rewriting extensive parts of the application, as there is no standardized binary API for SMT solvers. Also, since these SMT solvers have varying degrees of capabilities and performance and may not accept the same input, frameworks were created, that offer a unified API to several SMT solvers.
JavaSMT has exactly these attributes, a common API for SMT solvers. The framework provides access to a variety of solvers created using Java and other programming languages. Although most solvers share a common set of supported theories and features, their availability of extra theories and performance may differ. Therefore, the inclusion of additional solvers in the framework is advantageous to its users.

SMT formulas over the real numbers can encode a wide range of problems in theorem proving and formal verification. Such formulas are very hard to solve when nonlinear functions are involved. For that reason, the SMT solver dReal will be implemented in JavaSMT.
The SMT solver dReal is a solver that solves nonlinear formulas over the reals. The solver can handle various nonlinear real functions such as polynomials, trigonometric functions, exponential functions, etc. 
The goal of the project will be to integrate the SMT solver dReal into the JavaSMT framework and to include it in the existing JavaSMT tests."

Keeping in mind the
memory size of a single machine, there is a need to perform the operations in a
distributed fashion.
The main goal of this project is to use the mpi4py package to exchange messages
between different processes across distributed memory.
The main outcomes of this project are to develop a DistributedArray class using mpi4py to broadcast or scatter numpy/cupy arrays and perform basic operations like sum, product, dot-product, element-wise product, etc in a distributed fashion. Additionally, MPI functionality will be added to BlockDiag, VStack, and HStack, and the code for forward, centered, and backward finite difference stencils will be updated using Distributed Arrays. Lastly, at least one of the CG, CGLS, and LSQR solvers will be modified to use Distributed Arrays.
This will benefit the Pylops Codebase as integrating mpi4py into the codebase will
enhance the operators' performance and prevent exceeding memory on a single
machine."

Based on that, the writer plans to implement the p-median model with near-far cost allocation. By this, the spopt package can provide more accurate and efficient solutions to spatial optimization problems, typically for the problems with large data points, and large demand volume.

We would like to create a graphical virtual laboratory powered by QuTiP which allows users to explore quantum systems without being distracted by the need to write software.

The virtual lab would allow building up experiments from components (e.g. sub-spaces such as qubits, Hamiltonians for those subspaces, interaction Hamiltonians, environment baths), evolving the system over time, applying measurements, and attaching monitoring of quantum states or measurement outcomes (e.g. Hinton plots, Bloch sphere plots). 

Deliverables

- A graphical interface that acts as a virtual laboratory
- Allows the construction of simple quantum systems (e.g. placing four neutral atoms)
- Allows defining the evolution of each system component
- Allows defining the interactions between system components
- Allows coupling the system to an environment bath
- Allows simulating the system dynamics and visualizing their evolution over time
- Allows visualizing the steady state of the defined system

The performance of canonicalization procedures for optimization problems is an important metric for CVXPY users. Typically, this process is quite slow for large Disciplined Parametrized Programs(DPP). However, it is possible to improve upon the canonicalization by replacing the way 3D sparse tensors are represented.
One of the major updates of CVXPY 1.3 was the addition of a SciPy backend, which allowed a performance speedup for certain types of optimization problems. This new backend offers an alternative to the original C++ backend implementation (CVXCORE), and enables easier development. 
The SciPy backend has some limitations especially when it comes to manipulating sparse tensors with 3 dimensions. The current representation of a 3D sparse tensor is to use a list of 2D matrices. However, a sparse tensor of large dimension could be represented as a single strided matrix, which can make CVXPY backend operations orders of magnitude more efficient."

It allows users to safely backup keys by giving shares to various independent escrow providers, and recover the secret by passing user-selected authentication challenges at a sufficiently large subset of these providers. GNU Taler is a digital payments system that uses cryptography to provide a certain degree of anonymity when paying things online.

Some of the private keys that GNU Taler uses to represent money must be stored locally in the wallets, and thus, it is important to provide users with a way to ensure availability and confidentiality of these keys to avoid financial loss.

This proposal consists on the integration of GNU Anastasis in the Android wallet app of GNU Taler in order to allow users to make secure and decentralized backups of their digital wallets, and to recover the wallet data without relying on the user to safeguard their key material.

GNU Anastasis' client logic is already available in TypeScript, just like the cryptographic core of the GNU Taler wallet.  Thus, to make this work, we need to link the GNU Anastasis client logic into the GNU Taler wallet and then systematically expose its functionality to the user interface implemented in Kotlin.

Ideally, the resulting code should be re-usable outside of the GNU Taler wallet, for example as a stand-alone Android app to backup other key material or as re-usable Android dialogs that can be integrated with other Android apps in need for key backup and recovery functionality."

After comprehensive assessment and analysis of these issues by the developers, the developers have determined that the current code responsible for those capabilities  should be rewritten and refactored.

The reason that note subdivision and beaming can be difficult to implement is that music theory heavily relies on powers of 2 and their reciprocals. It's very convenient to composers, instrument players and developers too. That convenience doesn't address the problems rhythmic complexity can pose. Concepts such as compound time signatures, tuplets (group of notes that are not bounded by the powers of 2) and manually setting relevant Lilypond attributes. My project proposes a new way of  representing the concept of music theory beams and groupings with different object attributes.

My project proposes to fix this Lilypond issue by rewriting `lily/beaming-pattern.cc` (the C++ source file mostly responsible for this issue's logic) and fixing/refactoring relevant C++/Scheme source files. I plan to first refactor such source files to fix regular note automatic subdivision and beaming, then fix tuplet subdivision in later weeks. Heavy code modifications will include updating documentation, adding regression tests, and formatting Lilypond's `convert-ly` rules corresponding to the above two issues.

Once the issue of beaming subdivisions is fixed, developers and even anyone wishing to compose rhythmically-complex scores should not have to worry about this obstacle."

The open-source parameter optimization software Neuroptimus was developed to enable easy application of  advanced parameter optimization methods, such as evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence, to various problems in neuronal modeling. Neuroptimus includes a graphical user interface, and works on various platforms, including PCs and supercomputers. While Neuroptimus uses various built-in cost functions and the eFEL feature extraction library to compare model behavior to experimental data, it severely limits the range of neuronal behaviors that can be targeted by optimization. However, the popular model-testing framework SciUnit allows for the implementation of tests that quantitatively evaluate arbitrary model behaviors. Therefore, the goal of this project is to extend Neuroptimus to use HippoUnit, an open-source neuronal test suite based on SciUnit, to evaluate model performance during optimization. This project aims to develop a seamless integration between HippoUnit and Neuroptimus, enabling the construction of detailed biophysical models of hippocampal neurons. The new Neuroptimus-HippoUnit integration will allow the optimization of a broader range of neuronal behaviors, which can ultimately lead to improved biophysical models of hippocampal neurons.
Deliverables: 1-Implementation of an interface between HippoUnit and Neuroptimus to enable the optimization of a broader range of neuronal behaviors, extend the current supported tests to include all HippoUnit tests.
2- Integrate the HippoUnit with the Neuroptimus’s GUI so that users can run optimizations directly from the interface.
3- Integration of HippoUnit's useful outputs and plots with Neuroptimus for visualization and analysis purposes."

The latter simulates a cortical column with a depth of 2000 μm and 200 μm diameter, containing over 12k neurons and 30M synapses. Specifically, we aim at reproducing results from an experiment looking at the effects of increased CB1 receptor availability and GABA receptor deficits, as these have been linked to the EEG abnormalities that characterize schizophrenia. We will start by running batch simulation tasks to pull out connectivity rules from the A1 model, modifying GABA and CB1 Receptors. This step will be run on a scaled version of the A1, so that I will be able to use a personal computer, but I may employ cloud resources as well.Then, we will analyze parameter sweeps for local field potentials, using the LFPy toolbox.

Since data from these events can typically be formed into a graph structure, deep geometric methods, such as graph neural networks (GNNs), have been used as an approach to various HEP anlysis tasks. One such task is jet tagging, where jets are viewed as point clouds with distinct features and edge connections between their constituent particles. To enhance the validity and robustness of deep networks, embedded symmetries, which are present in many physically realizable datasets and fundamental physical theories, can also be discovered by the model through the use of invariant I(n) and equivariant networks E(n). However, due to the increasing size and complexity of these datasets, as well as the models which process them, an involved yet computationally inexpensive approach must be utilized. To handle an increase in the complexity of the data, I suggest the implementation of a classical attention (AT) transformer with the necessary modifications to incorporate, invariant or equivariant, and GNN layers. As the extension of classical algorithms via bit-wise processes to quantum algorithms via qubit-wise processes has been rapidly developing over the last few years, I propose the full development of general quantum invariant and equivariant graph attention transformer (QIGAT or Quantum Informer, QEGAT or Quantum Equiformer) architectures to meet the demands of requiring these machine learning algorithms to offer enhanced robustness through the adherence to fundamental physical principles while reducing their computational cost."

Gamma-ray spectrometers are among the sensors used for this task. They collect position-dependent energy spectra whose shape is a function of the components from different elements present in the area observed by the sensor at a particular time.
This data can be used to infer the relative abundance of each element (through a process called unmixing) and to map their distribution across a planet’s surface. However, accurately deriving abundance just from gamma-ray spectra is an intractable problem. 
Machine learning (ML) has been widely used to address intractable problems, including the unmixing of spectral signatures in the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Therefore, this proposal outlines the development of an ML model for estimating elements from gamma-ray spectra. This goal consists of two sub-objectives: (i) identification of the best model/architecture using data from the Lunar Prospector Gamma-Ray Spectrometer (GRS); (ii) a trained model for estimating elemental abundances from GRS data."

A major refactoring of the current system will speed up development of the current and planned map styles, increase their robustness and hence save time on maintenance / bug fixing, open up possibilities for perspective style enhancements.

Requirements for a new better system:
- predictable and easily debuggable, makes it hard to break things
- style files are nice, clean and compact
- promotes stylistic standards, e.g. standard font and icon sizes for various zoom levels
- supports easy and efficient sub-styling
- simple enough to be used by enthusiastic users, so that they could create custom styles
- powerful/flexible enough to describe the styles without much repetition
- future-proof, i.e. it should be easy to add support of dynamic styling, svg icons or other perspective styling features planned by the Organic Maps team

As a result, Organic Maps will run on a new styling system, which includes
- a new styling language syntax specification, including its documentation
- current main and vehicle style files migrated into a new format

In this area, Unikraft has made significant progress by prioritizing POSIX compatibility.
Through its binary compatibility mode, Unikraft allows unmodified ELFs to be executed, with resulting syscalls wrapped and redirected to the Unikraft core via the app-elfloader.
Currently, Unikraft supports loading both statically and dynamically linked ELFs in binary compatibility mode.
However, Unikraft has not been able to fully support all behaviors of glibc and user applications, which causes certain programs to fail in initializing or crash.
Additionally, running applications in binary compatibility mode incurs performance loss compared to ported programs, due to the TLS switching and system interrupts caused by binary syscalls.
To address the issues mentioned above, this project focuses on expanding Unikraft's binary compatibility mode by: 

* Using vDSO (virtual dynamic shared object) and vsyscall (virtual system call) to bypass binary syscalls.

* Expanding supported syscalls to provide compatibility for a wider range of applications.

This is done by attaching a probe to the tool head of the machine and scanning the surface of the finalised product to see if there are discrepancies between the expected result and actual measurements. 

Including such a tool on FreeCAD, which already has a dedicated set of tools for CNC milling in the Path Workbench, will not only bring it closer to proprietary solutions but even surpass some of them that don't have this feature. This would save time for the machinist and also increase the inherent accuracy of the whole process.

Building upon this, sensing solutions can introduce novel approaches to improve the CAM workflow and even generate new solutions not seen before. This proposal argues for an automatized post-processing of, for example, 3D prints by milling them to correct tolerances and inherent defects of the manufacturing process like layer patterns, over-extrusion or limited resolution. 

For On-machine inspection, there are already commercial solutions available so it's a matter of replicating their implementations on Python for FreeCAD. For the post-processing tool, a more involved overview of optimization algorithms for closely-matching volumes will be needed but it's surely available in the literature. If not, my background in mathematics and physics should prove valuable in the development of such an algorithm.

Thus, the main goals for the proposal are to prodive the FreeCAD Path Workbench with two new tools, On-machine Inspection and automatized post-processing of already manufactured pieces, and also to properly test and document these new tools in the FreeCAD wiki."

One significant problem is the difficulty in training models effectively, primarily due to memory limitations. The process of down-sampling these images to fit within memory capacities leads to the loss of crucial information, which can result in the oversight of small yet significant defects.

To overcome these issues, we can employ a strategy involving a tiled ensemble mechanism. In this case, images are split into smaller, manageable tiles. Each of these tiles is then processed using a separate model, specifically trained for that tile position. This strategy enhances localization and improves the detection of small anomalies, while also satisfying memory limitations.

Anomalib currently has a basic tiler. However, the advantages of locally-aware models, like Padim, are diminished without the support of a tiled ensemble. To address this problem, we introduce a tiled ensemble implementation that preserves the advantages of local awareness while also enhancing overall performance. 

This approach aims to incorporate Anomalib's existing features, while simultaneously providing users the flexibility to tailor specific steps within our pipeline. All the while, we ensure that our approach remains memory-efficient."

By automating the debugging process, the testing suite can significantly reduce the time it takes to identify and fix bugs, improving the overall quality of the website. The suite utilizes the amazing abilities of Django Framework and Selenium  webdriver to generate easy to work with logs.
The testing suite is designed to test all aspects of the website, including the user interface, the database, and the back-end code. It uses a variety of techniques to test the website, including unit testing, integration testing, and system testing. The testing suite is also designed to be extensible, so that it can be easily updated to test new features and changes to the website."

providing interoperability between storage and application providers using a
universal set of APIs. 

Currently, Reva’s notifications system is under development. In the next
few weeks, a small set of actions in the notifications system will be launched,
including
• Notifying a user you shared a file/folder with them via email.
• Notifying a user you uploaded a file to a folder they shared with you.

I propose to improve this notifications center with several additions.
The notifications would have a new settings option in which the user can
primarily choose which MIME type and possibly file type he wants to receive
notifications for.

This is to be done with additions to the database schema, possibly designing
a completely new schema. Also, there is major work to be done in the back-end
system in order to fully support this feature, and of course lastly, in the front
end - there needs to be work done on creating the settings window and parsing
the user choices for the setting they want to choose.

After this, another improvement can be done to the notifications center
which is the ability to get metrics on certain data - in particular how many
files/folders of a certain type or in general have been shared to this or by this
user. There is mostly work on the front end to be done here designing the
possible options in the settings to display this metric. But also work on accessing
the database to get these metrics displayed to the user.

Deliverables:
The extension of the simple notifications into a notifications center in the
UI, including settings for filtering the MIME type of the file
• Documentation on the implementation, reusability, extensibility, and testability
of the system, alongside a guide on how to use the UI.
• This includes extensions of the current back-end architecture as well as

The first step in applying GNNs to particle detector data is to construct edges between hits, which then enables a GNN to operate on the graph and generate predicted trajectories. The current process for graph construction involves constructing all possible edges first and then removing edges that violate manually set geometric constraints. This project aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of this graph construction step by creating a point cloud network (PCN) with PyTorch Geometric to perform this task. PCNs are a recently developed class of neural networks that operate directly on point cloud data, and they could be used to perform graph construction without manually selected geometric constraints and with fewer edge constructions in total. This project also involves optimizing hyperparameters for the PCN model architecture and the training process by using Ray tune and Optuna."

In this project, I aim to investigate whether small efficiency improvements in the LHC software can have a large energetic impact, given the sheer volume of data involved. Additionally, I aim to explore the impact of different computing architectures and job submission systems on energy efficiency. To achieve these goals, I will use metrics from the Green Software Foundation and other resources to estimate energy efficiency. I will then evaluate whether to make small changes to the code to improve efficiency and evaluate the potential savings. I will also test the software on different platforms and job submission systems.

Due to a current Spark limitation, it is not possible for multiple notebooks to share the same set of Spark resources. In addition, the process of spawning the Spark resources could take a while, and may add an inconvenience.

Currently, an effort is underway to employ a client-server architecture known as Spark Connect. This would allow multiple notebooks to connect to a previously instantiated Spark session and submit computations to it.

To make allocating Spark resources easier for users, this project proposes the development of a JupyterLab extension. The extension shall have a friendly interface that would allow users to instantiate one or more Spark sessions–in which the notebook will be able to connect, configure proper credentials and authentication, and make the connection accessible to the notebook code.

Consequently, users do not have to manually manage memory, and can more easily avoid memory management issues such as memory leak. However, the program being executed must be stopped for the GC to run. Therefore the efficiency of the GC algorithm will affect the performance of the program.

The project’s goal is to reduce the cost of GC when there are multiple fibers. Fibers are a memory efficient way to implement cooperative concurrency. Programmers control scheduling of the fiber instead of the operating system, making it possible to better allocate CPU resources. Ruby 3.0, released in 2020, added a Fiber Scheduler, which enables asynchronous behaviour in programs. Ruby’s GC scans through a program’s memory at various points during its execution, identifies which objects are no longer used, and removes them using an incremental tri-color mark and sweep algorithm and generational garbage collection. Improving the GC cost when there are many fibers will enhance the performance of Ruby programs, particularly asynchronous Ruby programs making use of fibers.

1. Reproducible test that triggers GC for fibers
2. Identification of GC bottlenecks for fibers
3. Reduction of bottlenecks compared to benchmark test through improvements to GC

Unfortunately, allocating superpages can often fail due to a high rate of external fragmentation in physical memory. Thus external physical memory fragmentation in modern operating systems has once again become a serious issue.

This project aims to design and implement several anti-fragmentation mechanisms for the FreeBSD kernel.
At the time of writing, the FreeBSD kernel has no memory compaction mechanisms or any way of quantifying physical memory fragmentation.
The first major goal is implementing several fragmentation metrics for the page allocation code.
The second major goal is designing and implementing a runtime physical memory compaction mechanism.
When invoked, this mechanism would identify sparsely populated
and fragmented physical memory regions and rearrange the pages to eliminate any ""holes"" in the region. Aside from explicit invocation, a background daemon would monitor
the relevant fragmentation metric and trigger the memory compaction mechanism should the value drop below a certain threshold.
The last goal will introduce a passive anti-fragmentation mechanism for the demand paging mechanism. The key idea is to enhance the page placement code to
use contiguous spans of pages instead of allocating random pages."

Different open-source architecture frameworks have been developed by the community, like OpenPiton, however, all of them present performance limitations that impact their ability to execute computationally-intensive tasks. 

OpenPiton is an open-source framework for designing many-core processors. Although OpenPiton was originally developed for SPARC v9 architectures, currently it is also compatible with different core architectures (RISC-V 32-bit, RISC-V 64-bit, x86, and SPARCv9). In this project, we will focus on improving the performance of the integration of CVA6/Ariane into OpenPiton (OpenPiton+Ariane).

The architecture of OpenPiton consists of one chipset and one or more tiles. The chipset houses modules used to communicate the tiles with the peripherals, such as the UART. The tile is used to build the mesh for many-core designs. In these designs, the tiles are interconnected by three NoC routers to generate the mesh. Each tile comprises the three NoC routers, the Ariane core, and the cache hierarchy, which consists of Ariane’s private L1 data and instruction caches, a private L1.5 cache and a shared distributed L2 cache. 

Despite the fact that OpenPiton offers many advantages, it presents performance limitations that restrict its adoption in the HPC field. In this project, we will improve the performance of OpenPiton by replacing the L1 data cache of Ariane with the High-Performance, Multi-Requester, Out-of-Order, L1 data cache (HPDcache). In addition, other features such as the amount of L1.5 cache miss status holding registers (MSHRs) or the L1.5 cache associativity can also be improved in order to approach OpenPiton even closer to the HPC field."

In order to do so, there needs to be a C++ implementation of a code-generation algorithm that can generate efficient code for any type of sparse tensor operation. This abstraction allows one to maintain a relatively small piece of code that enables functionality for an exponential number of different sparse array format operations. The main objective of the project is to implement, test and document the merge lattice and its related data structures and algorithms that are vital for code-generation. This will result in a generalizable code-generation algorithm that can be applied for implementing a variety of different sparse ndarray formats that work together. This will involve interfacing heavily with the existing C++ code and its implemented templates to add functionality that constructs and manipulates a merge lattice, which is a useful abstraction in code-generation for sparse tensor algebra operations. As a few stretch goals, I plan on: i) implementing abstractions of what a sparse array is and what operations can be done that leverage this underlying core API, ii) finishing the co-iteration algorithm to account for non-unique and non-ordered levels and iii) begin work on the actual code-generation algorithm that leverages the merge lattice."

The algorithms would be implemented in the ASR code, which would make them independent of any specific frontend. Any frontend that uses the ASR code could then make use of the symbolic algorithms without having to reimplement them. LPython, in this case, would not implement the symbolic algorithms themselves, but would instead parse the syntax used by the SymPy library, which already has a rich set of symbolic algorithms, and use the ASR representation of these expressions to perform various operations. This would allow LPython to have powerful symbolic manipulation capabilities without having to reinvent the wheel."

Studies of visual perception and attention in particular are increasingly integrating eye-tracking and EEG/MEG devices, in order to gain a better understanding of these processes and their neural correlates. However, the Python community has yet to coalesce around a well-supported package for analyzing eye-tracking signals. 

This project proposes to integrate support for reading, visualizing, and analyzing eye-tracking signals in MNE-Python.  By incorporating the ability to analyze eye-tracking data into MNE-Python, researchers would be able to analyze both neural and eye movement data within the same software environment, making MNE-Python more versatile and useful for a wider range of research questions. Finally, MNE-Python has a large community of developers and users, making it likely that eye-tracking integration will prove useful for many in the scientific Python community.

This project will focus on building a robust I/O routine for eye-tracking data and developing functions for preprocessing, visualization, and analytical routines that are commonly required in eye-tracking research. This includes the ability to interpolate eye-position data during blinks, produce heatmap plots of eye-position across trials, and estimate the deconvolved pupil response."

View Layout and Restoring::
The mscolab project is a collaborative software platform that enables multiple users to work together on a shared project in real-time. The project is written in Python and uses the PyQT GUI library for the user interface. Currently, the PyQT Gui of the MSS client can handle different views by one flight path. However, once a new flight path is loaded and activated, all views change to this flight path. This is inconvenient for users who want to work on multiple flight paths simultaneously. Additionally, the view configuration consists of many windows with a complex set of configuration options that are tedious to re-create after shutting down the application.
This proposal aims to improve the mscolab user interface by adding the ability to store and restore the view configuration of multiple windows for the user. Additionally, the proposal seeks to add a layout option for any participant on the same flight path, as well as the ability for the creator of an operation to set the layout of all participants."

Project 1) Improving Test Coverage

Problem: Vorta has a current test code coverage of 72%, and we would like to get this in the 80% - 85% range. Additionally, current testing files need more a consistent file structure and organization.

Solution: Work with organization mentors to prioritize test code coverage. Create unit and integration tests to reach our target code coverage. Reorganize and restructure testing file.

Deliverables: At least 80% code coverage, with a stretch goal of 85%. Test files separated into unit tests vs integration tests. Consistency in file naming and structure across all test files.

Project 2) Implement Profile Sidebar

Problem: The current profile selector and setting tab implementation mixes global setting with profile specific settings. 

Solution: Move the profile selector and settings button to a collapsible sidebar. The settings button opens a new interface with options relating to global settings and profile management, while the individual profile buttons open to profile specific settings.

Deliverables: A new sidebar with profile selector and setting button, as well as a new setting interface. Unit and integration testing accompanying all new features.

Project 3: Test on Live Borg Binary

Problem: Currently we test on static mock files of Borg JSON output. This task would improve testing to run on actual Borg versions/binaries.

Solution: Test multiple versions of Borg using Tox to simplify testing. Implement these changes in setup.cfg

Deliverables: CICD running tests on live Borg binaries with > 99% success rate. Include the option to run existing integration tests locally. Include thorough documentation of this process."

This allows for several undesirable configurations, such as self-intersecting rings, badly nested rings (inner outside outer), and inner rings that split the interior of the polygon into multiple disjoint parts. Such undesirable configurations are considered as invalid polygons in many applications, such as in Geographic Information Systems through ISO 19107.

The aim of this project is to incorporate the polygon repair method originally described in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2014.01.009 (but later improved) as a CGAL package. This method consists of three steps: (1) a constrained triangulation of the polygon, (2) labelling of its faces as interior/exterior, (3) extraction of the resulting polygon(s) from the sets of labelled triangular faces.

The method is already implemented using CGAL and freely available as prepair: https://github.com/tudelft3d/prepair. Integrating it with CGAL as a new package would likely involve switching the code's GDAL dependency with new functions for native CGAL types, adding some functionality in the CGAL 2D/3D Triangulations package (proper deletion of constraints), and the writing of CGAL-style templated code (with support for different kernels and so on)."

The navigation through the site is also challenging. All of these factors could discourage new users from adopting the system. The goal of this project is to overhaul the Uptane.io website to create a better user experience through more logical organization and easier navigation."

    This project aims to enhance the speech recognition engine used in Automotive Grade Linux by creating a natural language intent engine that can understand and respond to commands. The goal is to develop a voice assistant which can understand voice commands and take necessary action based on them (e.g. turn down the volume, increase ac temperature).

Implementation Details:
    The current Vosk Kaldi voice assistant will be integrating the Snips NLU engine to enhance its existing speech-to-text capabilities. The NLU engine will help in extracting the context and intent of voice commands. The extracted intent will be used directly or indirectly by a controller which will execute it by communicating with the underlying application APIs. 

Deliverables:
    1.) Integration and development of Snips Natural Language Understanding Intent Engine with existing Vosk implementation.
    2.) Ability to execute the intent extracted from the NLU engine using some sort of interface that will communicate with the APIs."

And listings of IPP print services have different requirements: One server can have more than one individual print service and these should get listed together. This could be a print queue and a fax out queue of the same multi-function printer, or two physical legacy printers supported by one Printer Application. Also the user interaction coupled to each listing is different. We do not need to configure PPD option settings, but instead, we need access to the IPP service's web administration interface and also to an IPP System Service configuration panel by a simple mouse click.

This is called Continuous Integration (CI).
What is triggered on each commit is usually some static analysis of the code using common, specialized tools and build and execution tests, usually doing `./configure; make; make test` on different system platforms.
This naturally requires test scripts/programs compiled and run by the `make test` step. For CUPS, for example, the daemon is started (on an unprivileged port so that it does not need root), queues created and listed, jobs sent, and the logs checked whether everything went OK. For Ghostscript, a large collection of input files (gathered from bug reports) is processed and converted into raster formats.
The task here is to write test programs for the different OpenPrinting projects so that `make test` does something useful, efficiently catching regressions. They should exercise important functionality of the software with different parameters and analyze logs and output files to check whether the program did the expected work.
Test programs are also needed for the so-called 'autopkgtest' tests which are added to Debian packages and executed whenever the package is uploaded to Debian or Ubuntu.
In addition, instruction files and shell scripts are needed to build the software on different platforms/environments, run tests, and create GitHub Actions (for the automatic triggering on each commit)"

This project aims to create a tool for Apache PMCs that will automate analysis of contributor activity in any given Apache repository.
Project Goal
The project goal is to make it easy for PMCs to manage their communities. We will try to achieve this by developing a tool that automatically finds and tracks first (or 3rd, or 10th) pull requests in a specified repository on Github that belongs to a specific community. The idea is that the PMC can take this data and send “Thank you” notes or emails to new people that joined the community and made their first contribution. If these automatic reports show that there are contributors with consistent commits to the project, PMC can send them encouragement emails to keep up the good work and become committers, etc. 
Project Description 
The tool will be based on using Github API to retrieve a list of all pull requests in the specified repository. Users will be able to set search parameters such as repository name and filters by pull request status.
Users can use this tool to:
Track pull requests in their own repositories 
Track issues opened in their own repositories
Track the activity of individual contributors to encourage them to improve
The tool will provide a user-friendly interface for searching and filtering valuable community information, such as pull requests, issues, questions in StackOverflow and others. Users will also be able to configure notifications to receive alerts about new pull requests.
Technical Details
The tool will be developed in Python and will use the Github API directly to fetch data (another possibility is using the  PyGithub library to interact with Github API, however this may not be necessary). For the user interface, we can use the Flask or Django framework. The tool will be deployed on a web server and will be accessible through a browser."

Agent is the core of this distributed system which does the heavy lifting of transfer jobs. Right now, agents have to be manually deploy and configure to start the transfer. This is a problem for researchers and people who need to transfer data without having much technical skills or time.

Updated Proposal Summary:
Updated proposal includes creating a desktop application and cybershuttle server to orchestrate the lifecycle management. This will guide cybershuttle agent and MFT agent from cybershuttle server to perform execution of jobs and data transfer, this would also maintain the lifecycle of cybershuttle agent and mft agents. This would help deploy any software and not limited to MFT agents.

The proposed solution is to automate the process of deploying and lifecycle management of the agents when a transfer job is submitted from an edge machine. This will help various researchers and people who needs to transfer data from a source to a destination without having much technical skills or time.

The deliverables are a piece of code to deploy the agent on various virtual machines, a piece of code to maintain the agent's lifecycle, an automated process for deployment and management, onboarding users and evaluating edge cases, and automated agent placement.

The benefits of the proposed solution are that it will make it easy and on the go solution for people even with less technical ability to use the vast speeds and advantages MFT offers. It will save time and effort for researchers and people who need to transfer data from a source to destination. It will make the MFT more user-friendly and accessible to a wider range of people.

Both custom defined & pre-trained gestures from Mediapipe’s tasks-vision API will be utilized to classify gestures and trigger events on the interface. 

The project targets most platforms, primarily big screens, and may run on selective mobile devices with a camera module for input feed. All data taken via input video feed is deleted after returning inference and is computed directly on the client side, making it GDPR compliant. Once completed, the Web App will be uploaded to Codepen and/or deployed on Vercel."

The custom dataset will be a CSV file with 10K rows and 4 columns: id, prompt, document, and summary. The document should vary in different writing styles such as news articles, blog posts, legal papers and so on, and the length of a summary will be between 1/3 and 1/4 of the length of the original document. This will make the custom dataset to be far superior to most publicly available datasets like CNN-Daily-Mail or XSUM, which typically generate 1-2 sentence summaries.
 
Then I will create a few text summarization models with different pre-trained models, improving each fine-tuned model’s accuracy by implementing strategy driven from bias/variance and error analysis.

After creating a few fine-tuned models, I will pick the best performing one based on the evaluation metric.

Based on this, I will work on creating a tutorial covering the whole process, such as creating a custom dataset using PaLM API, fine-tuning pre-trained models using Keras API, and selecting the best performing one based on a evaluation metric. 

As a result, by creating this comprehensive tutorial, the project will encourage other developers to explore/use Keras API and PaLM API in their projects."

The plan includes implementing the Text Task API, Audio Task API, and Vision Task API, which covers Hand Landmark Detection, Gesture Recognition, and Image Classification and Embedding. The project also involves testing and documenting each feature, as well as creating demo apps to showcase them. The project is estimated to take approximately 12 weeks, with each feature being developed and tested in a separate 1-3 week timeframe. The final week will be dedicated to finalizing documentation, creating code tutorials, and preparing the plugin for publication. The goal is to create a high-quality, well-documented plugin that is compatible with different platforms and easy to use for developers.

The main goals for the finished result of the project are:

- Multi-platform Flutter plugin for MediaPipe - The primary deliverable of the project is a Flutter plugin that is compatible with both iOS and Android.

- Testing and documentation - Each feature must be thoroughly tested and documented to ensure that they work as intended and that developers can easily use them.

- Demo apps - Creating demo apps to showcase each feature is an essential part of the project.

- Interactive Codelab tutorials - While not required, the creation of interactive Codelab tutorials would be a valuable addition to the project, particularly for the documentation phase."

However, GCC still accepts these obsolete constructs by default. Support for these constructs is confusing to programmers and potentially affects GCC's ability to implement features from future C standards. But newer versions of compilers (for example Clang 16, expected March 2023) are planning on becoming significantly stricter with the C code they will accept or reject. This is a huge problem for the general Linux ecosystem.

Even worse is that some of these failures are silent and lead to incorrect behaviour at runtime. Extra care must be taken to detect this and we must prioritize these cases because they're the most harmful. 

Also, in the coming years with C2x (likely C23), additional changes like removing certain depreciated prototypes will be made.

All of these changes will affect Gentoo packages in the following ways:
Lots of packages fail to build with these settings
Sometimes packages build successfully but their ./configure scripts have mis-detected features or otherwise made the wrong conclusion about the system because they expect a test to succeed when it now fails."

I have supplied multiple implementations that will allow these features to function effectively in the vast majority of circumstances. When lacking features are successfully implemented, the majority of the codebase will compile to LLVM.

However, it has several flaws, including sluggish performance and being overly interconnected with the core of SymPy. As a result of its flaws, a new assumption system, the ""new assumptions,"" was proposed about a decade ago. Since then, the community has made slow but incremental progress in transitioning to and improving this new system. One of the main reasons for this change is that the old assumption system doesn't allow for relation assumptions to be expressed. While the new assumption system does support relational assumptions, the current implementation is very limited. My project aims to address this limitation by enabling the new assumption system to make inferences based on equalities and inequalities, such as ""if x > 0, then x must be positive."""

To address this issue, LuCI applications must be migrated to JavaScript-based framework to reduce the load on embedded devices and improve performance. This migration involves rendering pages on the client-side using JavaScript, rather than on the router. To facilitate this migration, LuCI provides a JavaScript API that will be used to build web interfaces that can be rendered in the browser. To make this migration possible, new RPCD services will be developed to provide data to the client side that was formerly used directly on the router. This data will be provided in JSON format via RPCD (Remote Procedure Call Daemon) and UBUS. These new RPCD services will need to provide the same functionality as the old system but in a format that can be used by client-side JavaScript.
The migration of LuCI to JavaScript-based framework will offer several benefits to OpenWrt community and other users of OpenWrt-based devices. One of the primary benefits is improved performance and reduced load on embedded devices such as WiFi routers. By rendering pages on the client-side using JavaScript, rather than on the router, this will reduce the workload on the router and improve the UX for those interacting with the LuCI web interface. This will be particularly beneficial for users with lower-specification routers etc. Another benefit of the new system is increased flexibility for developers.

The end result will be a fully functioning data processing pipeline that is well integrated with the NeRF model training procedure, as well as online documentation that detail how to use the pipelines properly. There are 3 key deliverables for this project.

First, implement data loaders that can process user-taken images of real-world scenes. This will involve using the COLMAP and OpenCV data processing pipelines in order to extract the camera poses and epipolar geometry of the scene; these are requirements for the model's ability to learn a meaningful representation of the given scene.

Second, build, train, and test the actual NeRF model. This will involve using PyTorch's built-in CUDA support and extensive usage of the PyTorch library as a whole in order to incorporate critical components of the NeRF architecture such as positional encoding, ray sampling, and regularization into our model design. This step will also include rendering procedures that will allow users to extract images/videos, depth maps, and other logging information such as the training loss curve from the fully trained model.

Third, create simple and intuitive documentation on how to use both the data loaders and the NeRF code base. This will involve creating a page on OpenCV's documentation (via Doxygen) that will list out specific terminal commands that the user should use to train the model. It will also include a summary of required packages, recommended environment configurations, and links to other helpful resources such as YouTube video demonstrations, which will all be geared towards increasing the usability and accessibility of the pipeline."

Its primary objective is to create graphs that can support multiple backends, resulting in lightweight and fast image processing tasks. For instance, when running the algorithm flow on a GPU, optimized video memory access can reduce system overhead and enhance computational speed. To use G-API effectively, it is essential to (1) understand the framework's overall architecture and features, (2) compare its processing algorithms to those of other common frameworks, identify the unique benefits of each G-API function, and (3) combine these advantages and new features to enhance existing tutorials."

In addition, that tool should be extended to be able to run virtiofsd in a restricted environment with Landlock. Landlock is a Linux kernel module that allows unprivileged processes to restrict their own access rights. This will enable the tool to apply access restrictions to virtiofsd without requiring privileged access, in a way that is enforced by the kernel, thereby increasing the protection of virtiofsd users.

This is however of large interest to visualize both modalities for people involved in the clinical and analytical domain. Indeed a direct implication would be to have functional connectivity induced graphs visible along with structural connections (white matter). On top of which, after generating 3d maps, it may then be possible to visualize in space the functional connections versus structural connections. 

First of all, this project would be a useful feature to InVesalius, but secondly also to the neuroscience community. By having InVesalius open source and in a UI format it would enable clinical experts or neuroscientists without engineering background to have ready to go visualization of fMRI and structural MRI volumes. In general this could be extended to other modalities as well.

Two possible ways to simultaneously visualize structural MRI and fMRI are: 

1. Overlay different masks or contrasts (need to be carefully picked) for each of the two modality. There might be a need to apply some color distribution matching between structural and functional (e.g histogram equalization) since one would be T1 and the other T2 to have better visualization. Both slices would need to be co-registered prior to overlaying. The effect on the generation of 3D visualization would also be cared for.

2. Having two views or preview of fMRI in each orientation (sagittal, coronal, axial and 3d).
 Two views or one main view and a preview would require to have a tracker (dot) that points to the same voxels in the two views. This could be a way for the user to match regions for instance and essentially avoid crowding the visualization.

HPC data centers tend to have hundreds to thousands of nodes in their clusters. The use of “extreme-scale” distributed systems has given birth to a new type of bug: scalability bugs. As its name suggests, scalability bugs may be presented depending on the scale of a run, and thus, symptoms may only be observable in large-scale deployments, but not in small or median deployments. For example, Cassandra-6127 is a scalability bug detected in the popular distributed database Cassandra. The scalability bug causes unnecessary CPU usage, however, the symptom is not observed unless ~1000 nodes are deployed. This demonstrates the main challenge of studying scalability bugs: it is extremely challenging to reproduce without deploying the system at a large scale.

The project goal is to build a dataset of reproducible scalability bugs. Achieving this will involve analyzing bug reports from popular distributed systems like (e.g., Cassandra, HDFS, Ignite, Kafka) and determining if the reported bug depends on the scale of the run, such as the number of nodes utilized, the size of files, and the number of requests. Identified bugs will be used to build a dataset of bug artifacts that contain the buggy and fixed versions of the scalability system, a runtime environment that ensures reproducibility, and a workload shell script that would trigger some system functionalities and demonstrate the symptoms of the bug under different configurations.

The existing flow requires further refinement to ensure its stability, accuracy, compatibility with a wider range of netlists and VCD files, and overall performance. To address these challenges, the project will focus on methodically debugging the current implementation, establishing a comprehensive validation methodology for verifying the accuracy of power estimates, and optimizing the flow to handle larger netlists and VCD files efficiently. Additionally, the project aims to improve existing documentation by providing detailed explanations, examples, and tutorials to facilitate user adoption and understanding.

Upon successful completion, the project will deliver a more reliable, accurate, and efficient power modeling flow within LiveHD, contributing to the development of energy-efficient hardware designs. This refined flow will not only enhance the capabilities of LiveHD but also encourage wider adoption and utilization by the hardware design community, fostering innovation in the field of energy-efficient devices and systems."

The use of “extreme-scale” distributed systems has given birth to a new type of bug: scalability bugs, bugs that depending on the scale of a run, and thus, symptoms may only be observable in large-scale deployments, but not in small or median deployments. The symptom is not observed unless ~1000 nodes are deployed, making scalability bugs challenging to reproduce and fix. The goal of this project is to build a dataset of reproducible scalability bugs. To achieve this, studying the bugs in detail to understand the root causes, behavior and impact on the performance system and craft workloads designed to trigger the functionalities of the system under different configurations (e.g.different numbers of nodes) is needed to reproduce these scalability bugs. Having a dataset of reproducible bugs can help in developing better testing and validation strategies for scalable systems to ensure that they work as expected under different scales. Also to provide a resource for researchers and developers to study and address scalability bugs and contribute to the improvement of the reliability and efficiency of scalable distributed systems."
