Each rule is matched against features that CAPA extracts from a program. Extracted features include file-level features such as strings, section names, imports, and exports and function-level features such as API calls, string and byte references, instruction mnemonics, and number constants.\n\nCAPA uses feature extractors, called \"backends\", to extract features from supported file types (PE, ELF, and .NET) and architectures (32- and 64-bit x86). Each backend is built around an existing tool or library that provides file parsing and disassembly capabilities. CAPA uses this to extract features. CAPA currently implements backends using Vivisect, IDA Pro, and dnfile.\n\nGhidra is a popular open-source disassembly framework with a robust API to access its analysis. Programs can interact with a wealth of information that includes parsed file formats and disassembled code. The goal of this project is to develop a Ghidra backend for CAPA using Python 3 (via Ghidrathon) and Ghidra\u2019s scripting API. Users should be able to invoke CAPA such that it uses Ghidra\u2019s analysis engine and/or invoke CAPA from within Ghidra."

Currently, the project relies purely on static analysis of code structures to identify patterns. This project extends capa to work on dynamic execution data such as sandbox run traces or code emulation analysis.\n\nThe introduction of dynamic analysis to capa is set to make analyzing samples that feature anti-analysis techniques a much easier task. This is an issue of concern since a large number of distributed software nowadays gets packed with commercial or private packers, which means that capa would fail to profile these executables' capabilities successfully. However, this can be circumvented by introducing dynamic analysis to the problem, which it would enable capa to get a view of the program after it had been unpacked in memory, thereby making it possible to extract the capabilities from the executable at hand.\n\nDeliverables:\n1. Add support for the future integration of several sandbox solutions by means of an associated feature extractor.\n2. Implement a feature extractor for the Cuckoo-based CAPE Malware Configuration and Payload Extractor.\n3. Introduce capa features that are specific to dynamic analysis (such as captured network traffic).\n4. Add dynamic-based support for function call arguments.\n5. Write novel rules that make use of the newly introduced dynamic capability extraction."

In recent years, following the development of asm.js, Emscripten, Audio Worklets, and WebAssembly, the web has become an increasingly viable platform for DSP and audio programming. Prior work has enabled the generation of Audio Worklets (and older Script Processor Nodes) from Faust code. Furthermore, Faust has web-based tools such as an editor, IDE, and playground that allow people to easily try the language and hear the results without installing a compiler toolchain.

The first is to use packet filter (pf) for macOS, initially trying to swallow all traffic coming from the same machine that is launching packet filter itself. The second step in this approach will be to use some gimmick to figure out which packets are actually coming from mitmproxy and filter them out to avoid loops, a possible solution for this could be to use nettop, launching it as a command directly from rust, the solution is not definitive and possible alternatives should be explored to understand the privilege issue as well.\n2. A second approach is to use NEAppProxyProvider: an Apple proprietary framework that extends the functionality of the iOS and MacOS network stack. With NEAPP we can implement custom rules for filtering, routing, and modifying network traffic based on a variety of criteria, such as the app, the network protocol, the destination address, or the user identity. As it is a proprietary framework, we need to develop in Swift or objective-C and then transmit the information to the main mitmproxy stack.\n\nHow other proxies or VPN actually work:\n- WireGuard: wireguard has a apple version written in Swift, the adopted approach is the second one, it uses Apple Network Interfaces [ source ]\n- Squid: the same problem is  currently unsolved\n- TinyProxy: it uses  POSIX and no https transparent proxy"

Among all the brightness variations we can study in these sources, periodic and quasi-periodic oscillations are among the most interesting, because they can provide insights into the astrophysical processes in these objects. While the stingray package is a valuable tool for analyzing periodic data, its analysis of quasi-periodic data is limited by biases in frequency domain methods. To mitigate these limitations, a Gaussian process regression (a time domain method) can be used to model the time series for a kernel describing a QPO. Using Bayesian Inferencing, we can infer its parameters and assign them physical meaning related to the physics of the process and perform model selection between QPOs and alternative models. This can be used to reliably detect QPOs, and infer their physical properties. Such methods have already been implemented in recent papers (Huebner et al,2022), and the goal of this project will be to simplify their code and implement it in Stingray using the Tinygp library for the GP backend. It will also be accompanied by a tutorial and a demonstration on various datasets."

It uses a line-by-line approach, where each absorption or emission line of a molecule is computed by accounting for the influence of environmental parameters. High-temperature spectral calculations require resolving the shape of tens of millions of lines, which is the usual performance bottleneck. RADIS implements a new algorithm to compute these lineshapes and is already one of the fastest line-by-line spectral codes available. It can also compute many different types of spectra (absorption/emission/equilibrium / non-equilibrium). \n\nHowever, although the algorithm is very CPU/GPU efficient, the RADIS code is still memory hungry. Databases are currently loaded in RADIS using the VAEX [3] package, but the operations to calculate the spectra are performed using the PANDAS library. VAEX is a similar table management tool to PANDAS but uses memory mapping, a zero-memory copy policy, and lazy computations for the best performance. \n\n The main goal of the current project is to refactor RADIS so that dataframes are only manipulated via the VAEX format. Potentially, this work would make it possible to compute spectral databases of up to billions of lines (hundreds of GB or terabyte-scale databases)."

        "project_details": "Accurate gene annotation in eukaryotes solely based on genomic data has been a significant obstacle in biology since the introduction of next-generation sequencing technologies and thus the rapid increase of available data. Traditional methods either rely on homology searches to map the open reading frames to previously identified protein-coding genes or utilize additional experimental data, e.g., transcriptomics data. The first approach produces potentially inaccurate results if the genome of interest is not at least somewhat related to an already annotated genome. The second approach is hindered because gathering transcriptomic data is labor-intensive and expensive. For that reason, there is a high demand for models that predict the location of protein-coding genes solely from inherent features of the DNA sequence of the gene. Although theoretically possible, methods that use, for instance, Hidden Markov models to detect protein-coding genes based on known gene features are often inaccurate. In this project, we will train a Deep Learning Transformer model to extract features of protein-coding genes to gain deeper insight into their exact properties that lead to translation. The whole workflow will include first training a Conditional Random Field model to recognize candidate gene regions and then using these as input for a more fine-grained Transformer - Convolutional Neural Network hybrid model. The final pipeline will be tested against a benchmark of gold standard annotations as well as various test sets to evaluate the influence of different parameters like genome sequence quality, protein length or gene structure complexity."

Automated workflow with a has been developed to minimise the time needed to verify and annotated those transcript variants. However, current workflows are developed using a very strict rule-set and hence many of the novel transcript variants were rejected.\nTo address issue that strict filters rejects most of the legitimate introns,\nwe developed IntronOrNot (ION) - a machine learning to differentiate that predicts\nif the intron is real or misaligned. The model accepts coordinates, .bed, and .gtf file as input. The prediction script is easy to use and achieved comparable results\nto sequence-based deep learning intron predictor.

It will then use RepeatMasker to mask and annotate the repeats in the input genome sequence. Additionally, it will use Dust to mask and annotate low complexity sequences and TRF to mask and annotate tandem repeats in the input genome sequence. The pipeline will combine the results from these steps to output a masked genome sequence in FASTA format and annotated repeats in GTF format.\n\nFurthermore, the pipeline will use the tool RED to perform additional masking and output an additional masked genome sequence in FASTA format. The pipeline will be deployed in the cloud using the Embassy Cloud within the EMBL-EBI infrastructure to allow for testing and scaling, with the aim of determining the cost of running it at scale.\n\nThe main problem that this proposal aims to solve is the challenge of identifying and masking repetitive elements in large and complex genome sequences. The pipeline will provide a detailed and informative annotation of the repeats within the genome, making it easier for researchers to analyze the non-repetitive regions of the genome.\n\nThe deliverables of this proposal will include a NextFlow pipeline for repeat annotation and masking, a de novo repeat library for the input genome sequence, a masked genome sequence in FASTA format with repeat, low complexity, and tandem repeat annotations, an annotated repeats file in GTF format, and an additional masked genome sequence in FASTA format generated using the tool RED."

In this project, however, we focus on a function of SATIE is that implementing geometry understanding at a spatializer level. In this case, we usually apply the current version of SATIE mappers plugin to perform this function. A mapper plugin does not process audio, it can be used for provide for non-generic control and geometric computation of lower-level spatialization parameters. However, it still has limitations that need to be programmed for each use case. In order to perfect it and improve its efficiency, we need to design and implement the generalizable SATIE mappers that could get all loaded spatializers and set them at a relative distance concerning each other. In other words, it is necessary to make each different spatializer in different positions recognize the relative position of each other. The proposed mappers will be designed to overcome these limitations and will be tested with different spatializer configurations.

Then, we write the code to send KML data from our Flutter app to the Liquid Galaxy to visualize this data on the Liquid Galaxy rig.  \n\nNext, we make Arduino controlled pointer which emits green laser in the direction of satellite, which is controlled by the app.  First, we 3D print the STL files of the 3D projector. Then, we assemble all the components of the Arduino-controlled pointer. Then, for the application, we use flutter_bluetooth_serial package to connect and send data to HC-05 module.

The key motivation behind choosing the translation approach  is the significant performance improvement observed with the use of pre-trained language models such as T5 or GPT models in translation tasks."

A hard inner boundary in velocity is set from which radiative packets are emitted through the ejecta according to a black-body distribution at a given temperature. Currently, TARDIS can solve for the radiative and inner boundary temperatures as well as dilution factors given a static inner velocity boundary. The precise location of where this inner boundary velocity should be placed is not always obvious and there are a few methods by which one can intelligently select a location based on the properties of the plasma (which are constantly updating over each iteration).\n\nThis project will aim to update the location of the inner boundary velocity based on a set of options for desired properties of the plasma at each iteration. The options include setting the inner boundary velocity according to a given optical depth over all frequencies (either Planck or Rossland mean opacities) or setting the inner boundary according to a desired value for the dilution factors.\n\nThe project can be broken down into the following four deliverables:\n\n- Estimating the inner velocity value based on target values of optical depth and dilution factor\n\n- Integrate the estimation methods into TARDIS base\n\n- Write thorough test cases for all the above changes.\n\n- Make Jupyter notebooks and tutorials demonstrating the feature.\n\n-Thorough documentation of the changes.\n\n- Write a blog about the project."

With such comparisons, we can learn more about the physical processes occurring and the conditions inside the supernova, including which elements and atomic transitions are dominant. TARDIS tracks the atomic transitions of interacting photons, level populations, etc. allowing the user to interrogate the physical conditions of the supernova. The goal of this project is to build a visual tool to represent this information for the user in Grotrian diagrams, which show different atomic levels of ions and transitions between them. Developing this tool will allow the user to more easily understand the important physical conditions of their supernova model.\n\nA regular Grotrian diagram would only display the overall line interaction for the packets that interact with the ion, but we also want to display how many packets went through each specific transition and the level populations. One way it could be done is to color each arrow to represent quantity of packets (similar to a heatmap) and the thickness of the level platforms denoting the level populations. This project will have the following deliverables:\n\n- Develop an interactive widget which allows the user to look at the Grotrian diagram for specific ions which interacted with photon packets during a TARDIS simulation.\n\n- The widget should allow the user to filter on a wavelength range, type of line interaction (excitation or de-excitation), and ion. The diagram will also give a sense of the frequency of each line transition using colors.\n\n- Develop the above plot as a static Matplotlib too.\n\n- Integrate this widget into TARDIS codebase and documentation.\n\n- Create a Jupyter notebook tutorial for the tool."

Specifically, we will\n\n- implement the necessary numerical backend features to support thermal compliance and rudimentary fluid flow problems, increasing the available feature set,\n- implement appropriate front-end features to make use thereof, following the package's existing methodology,\n- and, as a reach, I would like to work on combining some of the above and propose a method for introducing multiphysics capabilities in some capacity.\n\nOf course, this all will be documented and tested alongside existing examples from relevant surveys/ the seminal papers."

For example, fonts where the capital \u201cO\u201d is taller than the capital \u201cT\u201d, or vice versa, should have these characters rendered at the same height when few pixels are available to avoid bumpy-looking text.  Many modern font formats  contain \u201chints\u201d in these cases, which tell the renderer how it should align each symbol in the font to the pixel grid to create the most legible and consistent rendering.  However, not all fonts and font formats contain hints.  In these cases, the auto-hinter can be enabled, which analyzes the shapes in the font to fix some common issues that would normally be fixed by manually added hints.  This project aims to further improve this process by adding corrections for specific letters, such as \u201ci\u201d, where the dot can merge with the stem, and \u201c\u00f1\u201d, where the tilde can lose its shape and become flat.

Once we establish a model to perform well on a modality we proceed to integrate the model to the AI Model service application.\n\nThe deliverables will include\n- Collate information on data sources, methods and models that will be used for implementation and review with mentor(s)\n- For any modality, start with data preparation, feature engineering, training and evaluation until satisfactory performance is achieved. Here we will trial different augmentation techniques and hyperparameter tuning methods. \n- Integrate the model inferencing code and retraining code to the application for all modalities\n- Add methods to the Flask API to appropriately call the specific AI model for a modality. Modify existing methods as necessary so as to include the new AI models\n- Perform unit tests, integration tests, functional tests and end to end tests for the implementations. Necessary coding standards will be used."

Although frameworks like Netty and NIO2 make this approach seem reasonable, the use of separate event loop threads is not without cost. In high-RPS services, these threads can compete for CPU time with worker threads executing application tasks, leading to resource contention and potentially significant performance loss. In contrast, Cats Effect offers a different threading model, integrating I/O and application tasks into a single runtime system, reducing contention an enhancing overall efficiency.\n\nio_uring, the key component of this project, offers two major advantages: (1) it enables all supported syscalls to become asynchronous from the application\u2019s perspective, allowing for multiple syscalls to be initiated in parallel without blocking the calling thread, and (2) it uses a pair of ring buffers for syscall submission and completion events that are shared between the application and the kernel, dramatically reducing the overhead of calling from userspace into kernelspace. When integrated with Cats Effect, io_uring can significantly improve the efficiency of syscalls, requiring fewer calls into kernelspace during the worker loop. \n\nThis proposal brings two key innovations together: a new threading model and a new I/O API. By integrating Cats Effects and FS2 with io_uring, we aim to develop an alternative solution to minimize the inefficiencies found in the traditional model, offering a more efficient and performant solution for I/O-intensive applications."

A patient's medical history and treatment may be well documented but due to lack of internet, computers and electricity in the next facility, that patient may not be in position to receive the service due to lack of reference document hence breaking continuity of care among health care providers, its is against this background that the print feature was development. so that at any point in time, a patient and the service provider can have a hard copy of whichever document they want.\n\nhow I plan to solve it;\n\n1. have a list of areas where printing is required and add them to the configurations\n2. Add the print button in the selected areas\n3. write code for the print function using the react-to-print package\n4. write tests"

Recently, Morris et al (2019) demonstrated an alternative specification of the BYM model that is significantly more efficient, interpretable, and can be identified with Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) samplers.\n\nDeveloping an implementation in Python with PyMC would make the model more accessible to a greater variety of users.

The coupling of cell and process can be achieved by decomposing the process into decoupled process units, which are then connected with cell parameters, e.g. areal loadings. The flexible submodel structure of PyBaMM would enable the use of independent \u201cplug and play\u201d economics e.g. for modeling different processes and economies of scale, as well as the combination of other PyBaMM models to estimate key values for degradation and thermal performance.

To satisfy this need, NetworkX has created nx-guides, which are pedagogical Jupyter Notebooks that clearly explain and experimentally explore (with examples) algorithms implemented in NetworkX. I added a notebook to nx-guides where I explain the traversal algorithms provided by NetworkX. In addition, new contributors currently do not have a roadmap for contributing to nx-guides, as mentioned by @MridulS in community meeting notes.

Taskflow is a C++ parallel programming library that organizes functions into tasks that it then can run concurrently or consecutively, depending on the user\u2019s goal.

After comprehensive assessment and analysis of these issues by the developers, the developers have determined that the current code responsible for those capabilities  should be rewritten and refactored.\n\nThe reason that note subdivision and beaming can be difficult to implement is that music theory heavily relies on powers of 2 and their reciprocals. It's very convenient to composers, instrument players and developers too. That convenience doesn't address the problems rhythmic complexity can pose. Concepts such as compound time signatures, tuplets (group of notes that are not bounded by the powers of 2) and manually setting relevant Lilypond attributes. My project proposes a new way of  representing the concept of music theory beams and groupings with different object attributes.\n\nMy project proposes to fix this Lilypond issue by rewriting `lily/beaming-pattern.cc` (the C++ source file mostly responsible for this issue's logic) and fixing/refactoring relevant C++/Scheme source files. I plan to first refactor such source files to fix regular note automatic subdivision and beaming, then fix tuplet subdivision in later weeks. Heavy code modifications will include updating documentation, adding regression tests, and formatting Lilypond's `convert-ly` rules corresponding to the above two issues.\n\nOnce the issue of beaming subdivisions is fixed, developers and even anyone wishing to compose rhythmically-complex scores should not have to worry about this obstacle."

The Rust compiler is portable, but its runtime library, libstd, needs to be ported to GNU/Hurd. This involves telling Rust how to call standard C library functions, which can be generated from libc C headers using the bindgen tool. The proposed solution involves creating a new Rust target for GNU/Hurd by investigating the system calls and interfaces available in GNU/Hurd and adapting Rust's code generator to generate code that uses these interfaces. The project aims to optimize Rust's performance on the GNU/Hurd platform by identifying performance bottlenecks and implementing improvements where necessary. The deliverables of the project include the Rust-GNU/Hurd toolchain, which comprises the Rust compiler and libraries, documentation, and optimized performance of Rust on the GNU/Hurd platform.

However, speed will be limited by the FHIR Genomics Operations reference implementation response time.\n\nA clean, easily understandable presentation of variants useful for manual review.\nTwo views should be provided: one for the most at risk variants, and another for a more detailed view of each variant in at risk genes. The former should have a graphical component. The latter does not need to have as clean of a presentation.\nUsers should be able to identify the most at risk variants within 5-10 seconds of the page loading."

Neuroptimus includes a graphical user interface, and works on various platforms, including PCs and supercomputers. While Neuroptimus uses various built-in cost functions and the eFEL feature extraction library to compare model behavior to experimental data, it severely limits the range of neuronal behaviors that can be targeted by optimization. However, the popular model-testing framework SciUnit allows for the implementation of tests that quantitatively evaluate arbitrary model behaviors. Therefore, the goal of this project is to extend Neuroptimus to use HippoUnit, an open-source neuronal test suite based on SciUnit, to evaluate model performance during optimization. This project aims to develop a seamless integration between HippoUnit and Neuroptimus, enabling the construction of detailed biophysical models of hippocampal neurons. The new Neuroptimus-HippoUnit integration will allow the optimization of a broader range of neuronal behaviors, which can ultimately lead to improved biophysical models of hippocampal neurons.\nDeliverables: 1-Implementation of an interface between HippoUnit and Neuroptimus to enable the optimization of a broader range of neuronal behaviors, extend the current supported tests to include all HippoUnit tests.\n2- Integrate the HippoUnit with the Neuroptimus\u2019s GUI so that users can run optimizations directly from the interface.\n3- Integration of HippoUnit's useful outputs and plots with Neuroptimus for visualization and analysis purposes."

The latter simulates a cortical column with a depth of 2000 \u03bcm and 200 \u03bcm diameter, containing over 12k neurons and 30M synapses. Specifically, we aim at reproducing results from an experiment looking at the effects of increased CB1 receptor availability and GABA receptor deficits, as these have been linked to the EEG abnormalities that characterize schizophrenia. We will start by running batch simulation tasks to pull out connectivity rules from the A1 model, modifying GABA and CB1 Receptors. This step will be run on a scaled version of the A1, so that I will be able to use a personal computer, but I may employ cloud resources as well.Then, we will analyze parameter sweeps for local field potentials, using the LFPy toolbox. Afterwards, we will move to parameter optimization of the A1 model so that it reproduces the ASSR, using the Optuna HPO toolkit. Our ultimate goal is to reproduce the ASSR phenomenon in the A1 model.

        "project_details": "Machine learning algorithms are heavily relied on to understand the data generated at the European Council for Nuclear Research's (CERN) Large Hadron Collider (LHC) which produces immense amounts of data through the measurement of the products of particle collisions. Since data from these events can typically be formed into a graph structure, deep geometric methods, such as graph neural networks (GNNs), have been used as an approach to various HEP anlysis tasks. One such task is jet tagging, where jets are viewed as point clouds with distinct features and edge connections between their constituent particles. To enhance the validity and robustness of deep networks, embedded symmetries, which are present in many physically realizable datasets and fundamental physical theories, can also be discovered by the model through the use of invariant I(n) and equivariant networks E(n). However, due to the increasing size and complexity of these datasets, as well as the models which process them, an involved yet computationally inexpensive approach must be utilized. To handle an increase in the complexity of the data, I suggest the implementation of a classical attention (AT) transformer with the necessary modifications to incorporate, invariant or equivariant, and GNN layers. As the extension of classical algorithms via bit-wise processes to quantum algorithms via qubit-wise processes has been rapidly developing over the last few years, I propose the full development of general quantum invariant and equivariant graph attention transformer (QIGAT or Quantum Informer, QEGAT or Quantum Equiformer) architectures to meet the demands of requiring these machine learning algorithms to offer enhanced robustness through the adherence to fundamental physical principles while reducing their computational cost."

Gamma-ray spectrometers are among the sensors used for this task. They collect position-dependent energy spectra whose shape is a function of the components from different elements present in the area observed by the sensor at a particular time.\nThis data can be used to infer the relative abundance of each element (through a process called unmixing) and to map their distribution across a planet\u2019s surface. However, accurately deriving abundance just from gamma-ray spectra is an intractable problem. \nMachine learning (ML) has been widely used to address intractable problems, including the unmixing of spectral signatures in the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Therefore, this proposal outlines the development of an ML model for estimating elements from gamma-ray spectra. This goal consists of two sub-objectives: (i) identification of the best model/architecture using data from the Lunar Prospector Gamma-Ray Spectrometer (GRS); (ii) a trained model for estimating elemental abundances from GRS data."

This would be extraordinary, as BioFormats is a Java library with no C wrappers available online.\n\nI started by refactoring caMicroscope code to use a single base Dockerfile which compiled OpenSlide. Then I made a Java wrapper and prepared its corresponding C caller. For this, I had chosen GraalVM C API, but once I found out about its level of performance and its requirement to achieve high code covergage first (for metadata collection), I rewrote it for Java JNI. To make it available to the two derivatives of our base image, I refactored this to be a separate project.

Therefore, a better test selection method is needed to reduce the load in testing while maintaining a high software quality.\n\nRecently, machine learning is used to predict whether a patch can pass a given test. This can greatly reduce the testing load because we can skip the tests that is very likely to pass when a patch is submitted. Although feature engineering isn't trivial, transformers have been proved useful in feature extraction under similar problem settings. Therefore, I propose that we can implement a machine learning based test selection method to select tests to run in the CI chain to reduce testing load."

This would save time for the machinist and also increase the inherent accuracy of the whole process.\n\nBuilding upon this, sensing solutions can introduce novel approaches to improve the CAM workflow and even generate new solutions not seen before. This proposal argues for an automatized post-processing of, for example, 3D prints by milling them to correct tolerances and inherent defects of the manufacturing process like layer patterns, over-extrusion or limited resolution. \n\nFor On-machine inspection, there are already commercial solutions available so it's a matter of replicating their implementations on Python for FreeCAD. For the post-processing tool, a more involved overview of optimization algorithms for closely-matching volumes will be needed but it's surely available in the literature. If not, my background in mathematics and physics should prove valuable in the development of such an algorithm.\n\nThus, the main goals for the proposal are to prodive the FreeCAD Path Workbench with two new tools, On-machine Inspection and automatized post-processing of already manufactured pieces, and also to properly test and document these new tools in the FreeCAD wiki."

One significant problem is the difficulty in training models effectively, primarily due to memory limitations. The process of down-sampling these images to fit within memory capacities leads to the loss of crucial information, which can result in the oversight of small yet significant defects.\n\nTo overcome these issues, we can employ a strategy involving a tiled ensemble mechanism. In this case, images are split into smaller, manageable tiles. Each of these tiles is then processed using a separate model, specifically trained for that tile position. This strategy enhances localization and improves the detection of small anomalies, while also satisfying memory limitations.\n\nAnomalib currently has a basic tiler. However, the advantages of locally-aware models, like Padim, are diminished without the support of a tiled ensemble. To address this problem, we introduce a tiled ensemble implementation that preserves the advantages of local awareness while also enhancing overall performance. \n\nThis approach aims to incorporate Anomalib's existing features, while simultaneously providing users the flexibility to tailor specific steps within our pipeline. All the while, we ensure that our approach remains memory-efficient."

This will save time and effort for developers who are new to app development and help them get started quickly.\n\n\nThe second feature is the implementation of a project concept where multiple screens can be grouped, saved, and revisited at a later time. This will enable developers to work on different parts of the app separately and easily switch between them.\n\n\nThe third feature is the use of the flow concept from https://reactflow.dev. This will allow each project to be represented as a flow, with each screen represented by a block. Actions can be connected to other blocks to visualise the app's lifecycle. This will make the development process more visual and easier to understand.\n\n\nThe last feature is the ability to \"compile the flow\" and run it as a demo. This will allow developers to quickly present a mock or app to validate its usefulness. This will save time and effort for developers who want to get feedback on their app quickly.\n\n\nOverall, Playground 2.0 is an app development platform that makes the development process faster, more visual, and easier to understand. It includes several features that will help developers create custom apps and integrations quickly and efficiently."

However, there is currently no way to gather data about CPU and memory usage during execution time, which makes it difficult to make further performance improvements to the project. Therefore, this project seeks to remedy this by creating a set of tools to gather performance data about the IDS execution behavior.\nTo improve performance data gathering capabilities, the following features will be added to the project:\n- CPU profiling module\n- Memory profiling module\n- Both modules will allow for: Export of profile data, output as both absolute and difference from input profile baseline (if provided), output as data stream\n- CPU/Memory data visualization/analysis module which can: Show process resource usage over time, can restrict to top however many if desired, histogram of resource consumption and time spent at consumption level for a single module, and recommendation lists for modules needing optimization, scoring criteria based on highest memory/CPU usage, longest blocking time, and weighted aggregate score."

Develop a M2M transformation tool that can automatically generate intent examples from OpenAPI descriptions. 2. Automate the creation of intent examples from OpenAPI descriptions directly in the dflow platform. By achieving these objectives, dflow can make the VA development process much easier, saving time and effort for developers.

This is where Numba can help. Since Numba compiles the code in loops into machine code it only has to cross the language barrier once and the loops thus run faster.\nInitial support for Cppyy objects in Numba enabled the use of builtin types and classes, but some essential C++ features, such as references and STL classes, are not yet supported.\n\n\nThe project aims to add support for C++ reference types in Numba through Cppyy and improve the existing numba extension implementation to provide general support for C++ templates.

Charged particle tracking entails reconstructing the trajectory of charged particles produced after particle collisions, and the scalability of GNNs could enable this task to be performed with high efficiency. The first step in applying GNNs to particle detector data is to construct edges between hits, which then enables a GNN to operate on the graph and generate predicted trajectories. The current process for graph construction involves constructing all possible edges first and then removing edges that violate manually set geometric constraints. This project aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of this graph construction step by creating a point cloud network (PCN) with PyTorch Geometric to perform this task. PCNs are a recently developed class of neural networks that operate directly on point cloud data, and they could be used to perform graph construction without manually selected geometric constraints and with fewer edge constructions in total.

The analysis of this data requires high-throughput scientific computing that relies on efficient software algorithms. In this project, I aim to investigate whether small efficiency improvements in the LHC software can have a large energetic impact, given the sheer volume of data involved. Additionally, I aim to explore the impact of different computing architectures and job submission systems on energy efficiency. To achieve these goals, I will use metrics from the Green Software Foundation and other resources to estimate energy efficiency. I will then evaluate whether to make small changes to the code to improve efficiency and evaluate the potential savings. I will also test the software on different platforms and job submission systems. My expected results include a summary of metrics for software energy consumption, visualisation of test results, and identification of possible improvements to software algorithms. The project will provide valuable insights into the energy efficiency of scientific software, with potential applications beyond the LHC experiments."

Due to a current Spark limitation, it is not possible for multiple notebooks to share the same set of Spark resources. In addition, the process of spawning the Spark resources could take a while, and may add an inconvenience.\n\nCurrently, an effort is underway to employ a client-server architecture known as Spark Connect. This would allow multiple notebooks to connect to a previously instantiated Spark session and submit computations to it.\n\nTo make allocating Spark resources easier for users, this project proposes the development of a JupyterLab extension. The extension shall have a friendly interface that would allow users to instantiate one or more Spark sessions\u2013in which the notebook will be able to connect, configure proper credentials and authentication, and make the connection accessible to the notebook code. The connection and session will be persistent across multiple kernels and restarts."

The student can choose to build this based on existing implementations in TMVA or other existing machine learning software tools or build their own from scratch.

Also, the user should be able to view the dimensions of the individual detector parts. Apart from this, the users should be able to navigate to the individual detector parts. My plan for the first problem is to introduce a 3D cartesian grid with multiple equally spaced XY, YZ, and ZX planes, as well as, to be able to display the 3D coordinates of a point on clicking. For this, I will make use of the ThreeJS raycaster intersects. Also, I am planning to render the Euclidean distance between any two points clicked. To view the dimensions of the detector, I am planning to render the dimensions of the bounding box of the component. The solution for the second problem would be to list the detector parts and let the user select any one of them, after which it will be highlighted using a ThreeJS outline pass."

For this, I propose a multi-modal multi-phase pipeline that captures different patterns of body gestures and speech phrases aligned with an articulated time. The three-stage pipeline begins with pose feature extraction in which both supervised\nand unsupervised approaches shall be incorporated to classify and cluster various gesture classes. In the next stage phrase features are extracted. These extracted features are then passed through the next stage. This stage will produce a synchronized dataset by aligning extracted features in time by applying late fusion. Lastly, Apriori Algorithm is applied to identify the frequent phrase and gesture combinations. Further, the project can be merged into production in a Red Hen pipeline."

Consequently, users do not have to manually manage memory, and can more easily avoid memory management issues such as memory leak. However, the program being executed must be stopped for the GC to run. Therefore the efficiency of the GC algorithm will affect the performance of the program.\n\nThe project\u2019s goal is to reduce the cost of GC when there are multiple fibers. Fibers are a memory efficient way to implement cooperative concurrency. Programmers control scheduling of the fiber instead of the operating system, making it possible to better allocate CPU resources. Ruby 3.0, released in 2020, added a Fiber Scheduler, which enables asynchronous behaviour in programs. Ruby\u2019s GC scans through a program\u2019s memory at various points during its execution, identifies which objects are no longer used, and removes them using an incremental tri-color mark and sweep algorithm and generational garbage collection. Improving the GC cost when there are many fibers will enhance the performance of Ruby programs, particularly asynchronous Ruby programs making use of fibers.\n\nDeliverables:\n1. Reproducible test that triggers GC for fibers\n2. Identification of GC bottlenecks for fibers\n3. Reduction of bottlenecks compared to benchmark test through improvements to GC\n4. Documentation of the above"

Aside from explicit invocation, a background daemon would monitor\nthe relevant fragmentation metric and trigger the memory compaction mechanism should the value drop below a certain threshold.\nThe last goal will introduce a passive anti-fragmentation mechanism for the demand paging mechanism.

Different open-source architecture frameworks have been developed by the community, like OpenPiton, however, all of them present performance limitations that impact their ability to execute computationally-intensive tasks. \n\nOpenPiton is an open-source framework for designing many-core processors. Although OpenPiton was originally developed for SPARC v9 architectures, currently it is also compatible with different core architectures (RISC-V 32-bit, RISC-V 64-bit, x86, and SPARCv9). In this project, we will focus on improving the performance of the integration of CVA6/Ariane into OpenPiton (OpenPiton+Ariane).\n\nThe architecture of OpenPiton consists of one chipset and one or more tiles. The chipset houses modules used to communicate the tiles with the peripherals, such as the UART. The tile is used to build the mesh for many-core designs. In these designs, the tiles are interconnected by three NoC routers to generate the mesh. Each tile comprises the three NoC routers, the Ariane core, and the cache hierarchy, which consists of Ariane\u2019s private L1 data and instruction caches, a private L1.5 cache and a shared distributed L2 cache. \n\nDespite the fact that OpenPiton offers many advantages, it presents performance limitations that restrict its adoption in the HPC field. In this project, we will improve the performance of OpenPiton by replacing the L1 data cache of Ariane with the High-Performance, Multi-Requester, Out-of-Order, L1 data cache (HPDcache). In addition, other features such as the amount of L1.5 cache miss status holding registers (MSHRs) or the L1.5 cache associativity can also be improved in order to approach OpenPiton even closer to the HPC field."

This prevents the substitution of sparse arrays for dense arrays when needed in many data science workflows. PyData/Sparse is a repository that presents an opportunity to address these issues. In order to do so, there needs to be a C++ implementation of a code-generation algorithm that can generate efficient code for any type of sparse tensor operation. This abstraction allows one to maintain a relatively small piece of code that enables functionality for an exponential number of different sparse array format operations. The main objective of the project is to implement, test and document the merge lattice and its related data structures and algorithms that are vital for code-generation. This will result in a generalizable code-generation algorithm that can be applied for implementing a variety of different sparse ndarray formats that work together. This will involve interfacing heavily with the existing C++ code and its implemented templates to add functionality that constructs and manipulates a merge lattice, which is a useful abstraction in code-generation for sparse tensor algebra operations. As a few stretch goals, I plan on: i) implementing abstractions of what a sparse array is and what operations can be done that leverage this underlying core API, ii) finishing the co-iteration algorithm to account for non-unique and non-ordered levels and iii) begin work on the actual code-generation algorithm that leverages the merge lattice."

For Python backend, we can simply use SymPy itself.\n\nThe algorithms would be implemented in the ASR code, which would make them independent of any specific frontend. Any frontend that uses the ASR code could then make use of the symbolic algorithms without having to reimplement them. LPython, in this case, would not implement the symbolic algorithms themselves, but would instead parse the syntax used by the SymPy library, which already has a rich set of symbolic algorithms, and use the ASR representation of these expressions to perform various operations.

I will also add the \"Change\" filter to the comparison view, which will filter only removed, added, and modified files. This task also includes adding syntax to allow advanced filtering and filter by size range as a stretch goal. These enhancements will help users easily find and manage their backup files.\n\nSecondly, I will improve BorgBackup testing by implementing live binary tests in Vorta. Currently Vorta contains stdout and stderr mock files for the Borg JSON output of various commands for testing purposes but there\u2019s no actual running of the commands. Moreover, it only supports one mock file while Vorta supports multiple Borg versions where output syntax may vary.\n\nThis project aims to improve Vorta Testing by implementing live binary tests that run on multiple actual Borg versions/binaries. I'll also integrate live binary tests with Vorta's CI/CD pipeline. \n\nFinally, I will implement bootstrap functionality in Borgmatic to restore backups from nothing, enabling users to easily recover their data in the event of a disaster. I will implement this feature by providing clear and comprehensive documentation, which will outline the steps required to perform a Borgmatic restore from scratch. This will significantly improve disaster recovery capabilities and reduce the risk of data loss."

Currently, the GUI only offers a basic set of navigation elements for selecting a file and returns the fs URL for accessing it. The goal of this project is to modernize the GUI using the Pyfilesystem module to make it more user-friendly and efficient.\nPyfilesystem is a Python module used for accessing different types of file systems. It provides a common API for working with various file systems, such as local, remote, and cloud-based storage systems. The Pyfilesystem module is easy to use and has many features that can be used to improve the functionality of the fs_filepicker.\n\nView Layout and Restoring::\nThe mscolab project is a collaborative software platform that enables multiple users to work together on a shared project in real-time. The project is written in Python and uses the PyQT GUI library for the user interface. Currently, the PyQT Gui of the MSS client can handle different views by one flight path. However, once a new flight path is loaded and activated, all views change to this flight path. This is inconvenient for users who want to work on multiple flight paths simultaneously. Additionally, the view configuration consists of many windows with a complex set of configuration options that are tedious to re-create after shutting down the application.\nThis proposal aims to improve the mscolab user interface by adding the ability to store and restore the view configuration of multiple windows for the user. Additionally, the proposal seeks to add a layout option for any participant on the same flight path, as well as the ability for the creator of an operation to set the layout of all participants."

Additionally, current testing files need more a consistent file structure and organization.\n\nSolution: Work with organization mentors to prioritize test code coverage. Create unit and integration tests to reach our target code coverage. Reorganize and restructure testing file.\n\nDeliverables: At least 80% code coverage, with a stretch goal of 85%. Test files separated into unit tests vs integration tests. Consistency in file naming and structure across all test files.\n\nProject 2) Implement Profile Sidebar\n\nProblem: The current profile selector and setting tab implementation mixes global setting with profile specific settings. \n\nSolution: Move the profile selector and settings button to a collapsible sidebar. The settings button opens a new interface with options relating to global settings and profile management, while the individual profile buttons open to profile specific settings.\n\nDeliverables: A new sidebar with profile selector and setting button, as well as a new setting interface. Unit and integration testing accompanying all new features.\n\nProject 3: Test on Live Borg Binary\n\nProblem: Currently we test on static mock files of Borg JSON output. This task would improve testing to run on actual Borg versions/binaries.\n\nSolution: Test multiple versions of Borg using Tox to simplify testing. Implement these changes in setup.cfg\n\nDeliverables: CICD running tests on live Borg binaries with > 99% success rate. Include the option to run existing integration tests locally. Include thorough documentation of this process."

Such undesirable configurations are considered as invalid polygons in many applications, such as in Geographic Information Systems through ISO 19107.\n\nThe aim of this project is to incorporate the polygon repair method originally described in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2014.01.009 (but later improved) as a CGAL package. This method consists of three steps: (1) a constrained triangulation of the polygon, (2) labelling of its faces as interior/exterior, (3) extraction of the resulting polygon(s) from the sets of labelled triangular faces.\n\nThe method is already implemented using CGAL and freely available as prepair: https://github.com/tudelft3d/prepair. Integrating it with CGAL as a new package would likely involve switching the code's GDAL dependency with new functions for native CGAL types, adding some functionality in the CGAL 2D/3D Triangulations package (proper deletion of constraints), and the writing of CGAL-style templated code (with support for different kernels and so on)."

Zephyr allows for easy handling of multiple configuration options, APIs and external components, and is well suited to structured application development. Another benefit of Zephyr is that it targets some very serious protocol and standard implementations, being e.g. the first open source RTOS to introduce TSN support \u2013 by way of Antmicro\u2019s contribution. The rising popularity of TSN in automotive and aerospace applications, and just about everywhere else, could be a very important reason to start using Zephyr in your TSN-capable product.\nThe goal of the project is to add Zephyr RTOS support to run on Cortex R5 processor core loaded from A72 core running Linux through remoteproc and add few peripheral support (Interrupts, Gpio, UART, Timers) for TDA4VM. The Cortex R5 processor cores are built to provide deeply embedded real-time and safety-critical systems.

Currently, new data sets can be uploaded to a separate repository for further review. However, to ensure full quality assurance, new data sets must be manually imported into an instance of cBioPortal and visually inspected to ensure the data displays correctly. This manual step is tedious, and presents a barrier to easily reviewing new submissions. \n\nTo resolve this bottleneck in the review process, the proposed solution will create a new workflow that will trigger upon a new submission to automatically deploy a live staging instance of cBioPortal, with the new data set already imported. Time permitting, a second potential workflow could also be explored to further streamline the process by generating resources such as screenshots for easier visual inspection. These improvements would allow cBioPortal maintainers to more easily validate new submissions, leading to faster approvals for new data, and a higher quality database for cancer researchers."

They would add support to load Acrostics from disk. Testing support will also be added.\nOnce the files are loading, they would add support to the game itself through widget work. They'd have to write two custom widgets. First, they would write an answer widget that contains a sub-grid and links styles with the main grid. Then they'd modify the clue row widget for acrostics to support the different types of clues.\nAs a final step, a separate widget will be written to add a custom layout for acrostics. Given those acrostics behave differently than crosswords, we want to lay them out differently. This can be done either by extending the existing custom widget, or them writing their own."

The go-to approach would be a D-Bus daemon that automatically (either on changes or periodically) creates a list of installed Flatpaks and pushes it to a service like GitHub Gists. If a new version is detected (which comes from a different system), the daemon would fetch it and adjust the local installation accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, there should be a GUI application that can interface with the daemon for setup and configuration.

We will try to achieve this by developing a tool that automatically finds and tracks first (or 3rd, or 10th) pull requests in a specified repository on Github that belongs to a specific community. The idea is that the PMC can take this data and send \u201cThank you\u201d notes or emails to new people that joined the community and made their first contribution. If these automatic reports show that there are contributors with consistent commits to the project, PMC can send them encouragement emails to keep up the good work and become committers, etc. \nProject Description \nThe tool will be based on using Github API to retrieve a list of all pull requests in the specified repository. Users will be able to set search parameters such as repository name and filters by pull request status.\nUsers can use this tool to:\nTrack pull requests in their own repositories \nTrack issues opened in their own repositories\nTrack the activity of individual contributors to encourage them to improve\nThe tool will provide a user-friendly interface for searching and filtering valuable community information, such as pull requests, issues, questions in StackOverflow and others. Users will also be able to configure notifications to receive alerts about new pull requests.\nTechnical Details\nThe tool will be developed in Python and will use the Github API directly to fetch data (another possibility is using the  PyGithub library to interact with Github API, however this may not be necessary). For the user interface, we can use the Flask or Django framework. The tool will be deployed on a web server and will be accessible through a browser."

Agent is the core of this distributed system which does the heavy lifting of transfer jobs. Right now, agents have to be manually deploy and configure to start the transfer. This is a problem for researchers and people who need to transfer data without having much technical skills or time.\n\nUpdated Proposal Summary:\nUpdated proposal includes creating a desktop application and cybershuttle server to orchestrate the lifecycle management. This will guide cybershuttle agent and MFT agent from cybershuttle server to perform execution of jobs and data transfer, this would also maintain the lifecycle of cybershuttle agent and mft agents. This would help deploy any software and not limited to MFT agents.\n\nThe proposed solution is to automate the process of deploying and lifecycle management of the agents when a transfer job is submitted from an edge machine. This will help various researchers and people who needs to transfer data from a source to a destination without having much technical skills or time.\n\nThe deliverables are a piece of code to deploy the agent on various virtual machines, a piece of code to maintain the agent's lifecycle, an automated process for deployment and management, onboarding users and evaluating edge cases, and automated agent placement.\n\nThe benefits of the proposed solution are that it will make it easy and on the go solution for people even with less technical ability to use the vast speeds and advantages MFT offers. It will save time and effort for researchers and people who need to transfer data from a source to destination. It will make the MFT more user-friendly and accessible to a wider range of people. It not just stops at MFT, in fact users can deploy any containerizable applications using this solution."

Image Data Preprocessing: Apache Beam can be used to create a pipeline for different image pre-processing tasks like resizing, cropping, normalizing and filtering for different image file formats like TIFF, PNG and converting it into a more standardized format like JSON.\n\n2. Model Inference: We can showcase how trained models can be used to make real time inferences in a Beam pipeline.\n\n3. Model Evaluation: We can evaluate the model using Apache Beam, utilizing various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.\n\n4.

JPF community has taken steps to add Java 11 support, but there are still some unsolved issues.\n\nIn this project, I plan to add better Java 11 support for JPF. This includes more comprehensive Java bytecode support, especially for invokedynamic, more JDK API support, and some bug fixes. It will fix all 13 failing tests JPF faces now on Java 11 and enable more programs to run on JPF."

For example, working over a prime field with a prime below about 20 bits, the mere creation of a zero matrix in SageMath takes roughly as long as the call of the underlying fast reduced echelon form procedure (performed by LinBox / FFLAS-FFPACK in this case). Still about FFLAS-FFPACK: several available tools in this library are not offered through the Sage interface, constraining the user experience; for example, some pivoting strategies are not available, despite their usefulness in some situations e.g. when one is interested in the preservation of some rank profile properties. Finally, the integration of linear algebra implementations from Flint has been initiated, with a good amount of work already done, but is not fully finalized and has not been merged into Sage.

To address this issue, LuCI applications must be migrated to JavaScript-based framework to reduce the load on embedded devices and improve performance. This migration involves rendering pages on the client-side using JavaScript, rather than on the router. To facilitate this migration, LuCI provides a JavaScript API that will be used to build web interfaces that can be rendered in the browser. To make this migration possible, new RPCD services will be developed to provide data to the client side that was formerly used directly on the router. This data will be provided in JSON format via RPCD (Remote Procedure Call Daemon) and UBUS. These new RPCD services will need to provide the same functionality as the old system but in a format that can be used by client-side JavaScript.\nThe migration of LuCI to JavaScript-based framework will offer several benefits to OpenWrt community and other users of OpenWrt-based devices. One of the primary benefits is improved performance and reduced load on embedded devices such as WiFi routers. By rendering pages on the client-side using JavaScript, rather than on the router, this will reduce the workload on the router and improve the UX for those interacting with the LuCI web interface. This will be particularly beneficial for users with lower-specification routers etc. Another benefit of the new system is increased flexibility for developers. The use of a client-side JavaScript framework provides developers with more options for customizing and extending the LuCI web interface. And this also provides a standardized way for developers to interact with the router's services which should make it easier to develop and maintain LuCI-based applications."

This project proposes integration with OpenSUSE's OpenBuildService, which also provides automation and remote compilation.\n\nThe plan currently looks like the following:\n1.

Get security approval, as documented in https://github.com/openSUSE/obs-build/blob/master/HOWTO.add_another_format.\n4.

Hence, resource allocation in wireless transmission plays a vital role in optimizing the throughput of a link.\n\nThe aim of this project is to implement a joint power and rate controller in user space using the Rateman Python package. As a rate control algorithm in user space has already been developed at SupraCoNeX, namely \"py_minstrel_ht\", this variant of Minstrel-HT can be extended with power tuning capability to better manage interference and increase spatial reuse. In general, the proposed joint controller will consist of a power tuning module that tweaks the power level of the set of best rates, selected by the Minstrel-HT, to an optimal value. Furthermore, the joint controller could also be extended to support modes such as fixed power and low power."

Optical flow is pivotal to many computer vision applications such as object tracking, video stabilization, and motion analysis, providing essential information about the dynamics of a scene or an object. With the upsurge in the use of deep neural networks, DNN models were developed to solve the optical flow problem, achieving state-of-the-art results by learning to estimate motion from image data. However, DNNs can become computationally expensive making it infeasible to be deployed on embedded systems. This problem is tackled by the development of lightweight DNN models. However, OpenCV model zoo hasn't had any implementation of an optical flow lightweight model yet. Thus, this project aims to find the best lightweight optical flow model in terms of model size, speed, and accuracy to introduce to the OpenCV model zoo."

Consequently, the high-performance tracker with fast speed on edge devices is critical. I have two plans to solve this problem. The first Scheme is to use the pre-trained lightweight transformer as the tracking models' backbone and through the proper design, the tracking model not only has good performance because of the use of the pre-trained visual transformer but also because the visual transformer used is lightweight and does not slow down the model due to the huge amount of computation caused by the transformer. The second Scheme is to build a small tracking model and pre-train the small tracking model using the MAE pre-training method, and finally, choose the current best-performing transformer-based tracking model as the teacher model to train the student model. Eventually, two state-of-the-art real-time tracking models will be provided, along with their code, and they will be maintained over time."

There are 3 key deliverables for this project.\n\nFirst, implement data loaders that can process user-taken images of real-world scenes. This will involve using the COLMAP and OpenCV data processing pipelines in order to extract the camera poses and epipolar geometry of the scene; these are requirements for the model's ability to learn a meaningful representation of the given scene.\n\nSecond, build, train, and test the actual NeRF model. This will involve using PyTorch's built-in CUDA support and extensive usage of the PyTorch library as a whole in order to incorporate critical components of the NeRF architecture such as positional encoding, ray sampling, and regularization into our model design. This step will also include rendering procedures that will allow users to extract images/videos, depth maps, and other logging information such as the training loss curve from the fully trained model.\n\nThird, create simple and intuitive documentation on how to use both the data loaders and the NeRF code base. This will involve creating a page on OpenCV's documentation (via Doxygen) that will list out specific terminal commands that the user should use to train the model. It will also include a summary of required packages, recommended environment configurations, and links to other helpful resources such as YouTube video demonstrations, which will all be geared towards increasing the usability and accessibility of the pipeline."

For instance, when running the algorithm flow on a GPU, optimized video memory access can reduce system overhead and enhance computational speed. To use G-API effectively, it is essential to (1) understand the framework's overall architecture and features, (2) compare its processing algorithms to those of other common frameworks, identify the unique benefits of each G-API function, and (3) combine these advantages and new features to enhance existing tutorials."

Indeed a direct implication would be to have functional connectivity induced graphs visible along with structural connections (white matter). On top of which, after generating 3d maps, it may then be possible to visualize in space the functional connections versus structural connections. \n\nFirst of all, this project would be a useful feature to InVesalius, but secondly also to the neuroscience community. By having InVesalius open source and in a UI format it would enable clinical experts or neuroscientists without engineering background to have ready to go visualization of fMRI and structural MRI volumes. In general this could be extended to other modalities as well.\n\nTwo possible ways to simultaneously visualize structural MRI and fMRI are: \n\n1. Overlay different masks or contrasts (need to be carefully picked) for each of the two modality. There might be a need to apply some color distribution matching between structural and functional (e.g histogram equalization) since one would be T1 and the other T2 to have better visualization. Both slices would need to be co-registered prior to overlaying. The effect on the generation of 3D visualization would also be cared for.\n\n2. Having two views or preview of fMRI in each orientation (sagittal, coronal, axial and 3d).\n Two views or one main view and a preview would require to have a tracker (dot) that points to the same voxels in the two views. This could be a way for the user to match regions for instance and essentially avoid crowding the visualization.\n\nThe language I plan on using and believe fits the project would be python. The potential libraries used during the project would include already required ones for InVesalius (e.g scipy,opencv)"

The use of \u201cextreme-scale\u201d distributed systems has given birth to a new type of bug: scalability bugs. As its name suggests, scalability bugs may be presented depending on the scale of a run, and thus, symptoms may only be observable in large-scale deployments, but not in small or median deployments. For example, Cassandra-6127 is a scalability bug detected in the popular distributed database Cassandra. The scalability bug causes unnecessary CPU usage, however, the symptom is not observed unless ~1000 nodes are deployed. This demonstrates the main challenge of studying scalability bugs: it is extremely challenging to reproduce without deploying the system at a large scale.\n\nThe project goal is to build a dataset of reproducible scalability bugs. Achieving this will involve analyzing bug reports from popular distributed systems like (e.g., Cassandra, HDFS, Ignite, Kafka) and determining if the reported bug depends on the scale of the run, such as the number of nodes utilized, the size of files, and the number of requests. Identified bugs will be used to build a dataset of bug artifacts that contain the buggy and fixed versions of the scalability system, a runtime environment that ensures reproducibility, and a workload shell script that would trigger some system functionalities and demonstrate the symptoms of the bug under different configurations. For example, a successful reproduction should be able to show the performance drop along with an increasing number of nodes."
